Cameron.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Then that's all you had to say.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Exactly my point
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Get her to act like a human
William didn't even go to high school
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Who?
Sure, I do
I hate him.
You never disappointed me.
It wasn't like that.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Which parts?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Dr. Ruth?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Appointment to what?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Thousands.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
What are you saying?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
That she was impregnable.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
They won't until this is over.
Somewhere else?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Go on.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
No!  Nothing happened.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Answer it.
I love you.
Okay.  You ready?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where is escort service?
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Don't want to film this?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You want the tape?  There it is!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Alright.  Go ahead.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Oh?
Yes, I thought so.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Roger.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Fine.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
That's true.
That's true
I understand.
Vodka.
I ain't tired yet.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Would you guys...
You're gonna help us take him.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I got a lot to protect.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
That's never been one of my problems.
What are you talkin' about?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I don't know.
I guess he got the message...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
What do you want?
Naw, right here's okay.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
You know exactly where they are!
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
How do I look?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
How many points you got left on your license?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Yes ma..
...Not yet.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
I don't think this is a good time...
Not without Leeloo.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Just one... why me?
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I love you.
I understand.
Why the gun?
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
Amy...
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Machine.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
They should be here any minute.
Sure.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
It's good what you're doing.
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
Yeah.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Because we're going there.
Tell me what happened.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Three, four years.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm here.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Yes.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Then you saw him, too?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
No...
Jesus!  Don't do that!
No.  A deal's a deal.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Krueger is reality.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
But I've seen her grave.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
So they caught up with you, too?
Huh?
I think you're right.
Right, Skipper.
What???
Yes, Griff?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Who with?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Come where?
- for horrors like yourself?
Toward the Pole!
No. Black.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
We bought you.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
If you get it?
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Piece of fucking cake.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Sure you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
He sure as hell won't.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
What then?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Fine.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
I'm sorry about what I said.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You knew me as a kid.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
When did she die?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Jack?
You no-good pup!
You remember Margie Fogg?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Love! I'm made of love!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
You think Jack shot him?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Want to know what I think happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
That it wasn't an accident.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Yeah.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
That's what you think.
Don't you even want to ask?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
He's busy being dead.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Because it is my duty.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Three...
Good. Good.
Twenty minutes?
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Excuse me?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Yes, sir.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Sir?
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I'd use the word insane.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Request; life support systems check.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
No. I'm all alone.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
You expect me to believe that?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Yes?
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Huh?
Thank you.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
You don't have squat.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
How the hell do you know that?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
In the other man's rectum.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Please, I must get out here.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
For you, anything.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
What's that?
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Did he find anything?
What?
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Can't lock up...
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
If I go.
She's right.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Dead on all channels.
It's insured.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Sure, Hicks.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
We didn't miss anything.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Seal the door.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Terrible.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Did you ever have a baby?
Newt, wait!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Oh!
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
Extremely clever.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
I want to go!
Yes!
Fartsbishop!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
What?
Eat my - ah!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
I love you! I love you!
Wolfi.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
No one.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Where's our friend?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
Gertrude!
Wine?
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
And the result satisfies.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Why not?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Well, look at them.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Enchanted, Madame.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
They say you're in debt.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
I don't know. He has pains.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
I liked the horse.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Animals?
What is this?
So let me see it. Where is it?
Mio caro Adone.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I can't say. Really
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I'm too young to be so sick.
Of course.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
On the contrary.
So?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
And do they believe it?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
My son, no one can speak for God.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I did.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Where?
Well done, Sire!
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
He said 'Jack'.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Shall I send a car?
I expect you shortly.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I was. What are you reading?
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you come with me?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Do me an enormous favor?
I've left those pills for you.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
David, let's go now.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
No.
No.
No!
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
What time is it?
Where am I?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
You ask them.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Stop it, Jack.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
You don't have to say anything.
Why don't we ask him?
What here?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Oh.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Yeah.
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Just pure luck!
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
That don't do us any good.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
What is?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well—
Why are you so anxious?
No.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
My apartment.
A misunderstood bachelor.
Oh, yeah?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Yes, sir.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
But I haven't . . .
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Yes, sir.
What are you talking about?
Come here, honey!
Yes.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh now, don't be silly.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Dude Finlay?
Yes, sir.
I'm okay, Matt.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Tell me.
How?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
Don't let it happen again.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Both would be nice.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
What do you think?
Ma.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
The posters?
And we're good at it.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Yeah.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Mmmm.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Stop it. This is just sad.
Pity.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
No.
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I can't believe this.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
I'm thinking Dorsia.
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Yes, dear.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Nothing.
Do you take American Express?
I don't think so.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
What exactly do you mean?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
It's just not.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Like what?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
I said we are totally booked.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
You didn't give them a name.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
Patrick? Is that you?
Just...say...no!
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
No. I really don't.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Who?
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
No, I'm okay.
No, really. I'm okay.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Nice. Very nice.
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Actually, yes.
Oh.
People just...disappear.
That's not the information I've received.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Suit yourself, I guess.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Oh well, you know.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
What?!
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Oh hi.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Right... Right.
What're you implying.
You look a little tired.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Wait... He knows.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
...Something like that. Yeah.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
Oh yeah?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Certainly not at my happy home.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Did you tell Alice?
What d'you mean?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
You may.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Behave!
Care for some saki?
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Yes?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Be careful.
Hey, Mick!
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Why?
Let me see.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
You know who.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Not now, Austin.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
What are you saying, son?
Shut up.
Silence!
Yes.
Right.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
You didn't...
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...
Love...
... love ...
Peter ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Have we met?
There, look!
Mr. John Steed, please.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
This isn't a game.
To you ... ?
Thank you, Steed.
You killed my husband.
'Our revels now are ended.'
Choices?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
Any other vices?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Strange.
Very good, Steed ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Shall we?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Not quite.
I know all this.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
We want Mrs. Peel.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may try to kill you.
Anyone particular in mind?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Stay by the window. By the window.
Perish the thought.
...Really?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Shit!
Keep me informed.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
What are we having?
It looks awful.
Oh... I got something for that.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mon, I knew it was you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Ilene, are you crazy?
Great, Mom.
Quiet, Mother.
Screw you!
Why?
What's going on?
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I just want to be alone.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's Bullwinkle.
You can tell a man by his friends.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
I don't know.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
We're gonna be okay, man...
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
It works.
Sheep don't count.
That was never proved.
Thanks for the speakers.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
-- Never mind.
-- What are you doing here?
Shut up!
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
What are you listening to?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Are you going public with this?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months.
I have a job.
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
What's wrong?
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn it all.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
I'm a Catholic.
Yes.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Are you sure?
What case?
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
How 'bout...
Yeah!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
And I'm the feet.
How you sound?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Nobody told me anything.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
I'm in till the end.
The big one.
The pleasure is mine.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I feel fine.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
You tellin' the truth.
Not her, the one with the little...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...not that time...
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
What?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
You can go now.
I never was more in earnest.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
How do you do, sir?
What is the service, sir?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
It must have been some other gate.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Only the agency of servants.
I believe they will deport you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Then you yield to me.
That is a trifle strong.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Not even that.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Old fool!
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
What do we do?
Shut up, Mueller.
I asked for a policeman.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Oh, come on --
Just look. Little pocket.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
Put it down!
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
No. Poetic justice, though.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
I don't know --
MAYBE WHAT --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Yes.
So noted.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I lied. Wait for it...
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Are you sure?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
That's gonna stay my secret.
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Poor fucker my ass...
But you didn't see it, right?
We've been making progress, I see.
Yeah.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
I brought it.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Make him stop.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
How what happens?
How I go.
Like this.
You say...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
You're not.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Of course.
Do you know who that is?
Yes. Thank you.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Such as?
He says he feels safe here.
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I do. I want to very badly.
In every sense. If at all possible.
I don't want to talk about him.
Why not?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes which?
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Well. It's good to see you.
Yes?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Can I put it in your mouth?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
I got others.
Better than what you give.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I CAN'T!
Itches.
No joke.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
I didn't start this, R.L.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Not like that.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Yes'sir.
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae don't do this now...
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
What?
Ronnie...
Get rid of it.
What?
The Wolf?
Maybe we should do something?
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
I said let's go, Charlie.
I hope not.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Give us a break...
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Are we getting married?
You were too far behind.
San is an honorable title.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
No.
Joyce?
Me too.
We can't lose.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Where's Ich?
No one's keeping him here.
Might be different in New York.
Save it, I already took the tour.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Yeah.
Why me?
It is not allowed.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Pris?
And what can he do for you?
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Yeah.
When might that be?
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
How do I stop one?
Prosit.
No thanks.
I like you too.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Huh huh.
What the fuck for?
Sorry.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I work alone.
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?
Dead.
I wish I could.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
No, I don't.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
Don't move.
What one?
But how come I'd be there?
Oh.
Is that why you're still here?
Sure.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Sure.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
I don't want to be alone.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Um-hum.
Good for you.
Yeah.
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
I like her.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Gee-ma-nee!
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
What's baseball?
Then why go there?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Yes, sir. It's true.
You nut!
And it's called...?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Does that work?
Thirty-five.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Well, where are you --
What about relatives?
Yeah.
Good god.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
You bet, hon!
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
I told you! I've got everything!
Yes.  Well... yes.
Sure.
Just open the door.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
I think...it...works.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Who did he leave with?
What?
He left with Sophie.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Give it back to him.
Yeah! That's thinking.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
What?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Stand by. One.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
The criminals are winning.
Yeah. I get it.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Nobody.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Nothing. Are you alright?
See my nipples?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Yeah, hurry up though.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Frank is coming?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
No police!!!  No police!!
Frank would open you.
Beeeee careful.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
No.  Hi baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Would you like a piece of cake?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
You've got a point there.
Alright.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yes. I do.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Two.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
Just a minute.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Probably not. No. Why?
Up where?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
What?
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Connor, is that you?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
Fuck!
Ass!
Aye.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Yes.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Three.
You... oh god, why?
Really want to know?
No way they could have seen it?
Twist of lemon!
Sweet-n-low!
Who were the victims?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, what'ya do?
I mean he ain't here.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Yes.
Open it!
Just be natural, goddamit.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
I'm lookout.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Just turn right here.
We got it. We got it.
On your marks...  Get set go.
This was in fourth grade.
That's a long time to be in jail.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
He seems pretty good.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
I'll see you there.
He did?
I'm not kidding.
Hold it.
How'd he do?
Death.
Why'd you want to help us?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
He looked too shaken-up.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Why do you say that?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Yeah.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Is that Buckethead?
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
No.
My brother.
Yes. I did.
I'll just drive my car.
Maybe she turned.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
His name was Swifty?
Bob, I've got nightmares.
So it's my fault?
There were more than that.
What the fuck possessed you?
We'll have to see when we get back.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Yes, I do.
Let's go.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
He's having a heart attack or something.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
He said you ran away from home.
Hand to hand combat?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
He's damn good.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
She is a good looking woman.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
It's locked.
One last push. One.
What?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Don't know.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
What?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Is this really happening?
I did.
-- my coat -- but we should --
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
He was at the campground yesterday.
Where --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
But you found another choice.
Who is Pamela Landy?
What do you mean?
No. You never worked Berlin.
That's a lie!
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Sounds like a threat.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Who's this?
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Alright...
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
He was a modest man.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
I don't want to be a martyr.
No. One of us is enough.
We don't split up!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Thank you for inviting.
You are. And I'll come again.
You scare me.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
It does me good to see you.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Can't he come out for one day?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Okay.
How long will I be in here?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Photos?
Like Ozzy.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Huh?
Hi, Lenny.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Like how?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
What?
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Because you're... different.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yes?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
What is your name?
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'd better be going.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
And the carrying charges?
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Richard, I had to see you.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Oh, Rick!
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Be careful.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
My office.
No. It's all arranged.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
And if it should change?
But I have no excuse to close it.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
A wise foreign policy.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Why two?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Is everything ready?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
You think of everything, don't you?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
I haven't the slightest idea.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I like it fine here.
You ever going to bed?
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
No.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
As much as anybody.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Well, not really, I --
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
Is that Jango?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
I'm so glad you're alive.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Not to mention on me.
Sure.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
I'm touched.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You should have smelled me.
To Wilson.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
I need to do it.
Life is waiting.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
I'm *not* a doctor!
Better than I can!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
I've never seen a lobster.
Okay...
But you had so much *responsibility*.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
What do you want me to *do*?
Sure. Thanks.
Hi...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
*Liver* killed him?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
A B-24 Liberator.
Have you enlisted?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Is it true?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
You do it then.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Sorry, Homer...
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Two million.
Just the last three weeks.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
I was doing it for them.
We'll take care of it.
Mob?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
We're going to give him the money back?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
Let's go, Jake?
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
You get an equal cut.
Just play a part. A little acting.
Why?
Did I miss something?
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Don't ruin this for me.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
You sure?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
And we got rid of the red head.
What?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
So what do you want?
I try.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What do you want?
I can imagine.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
You're all scumbags.
A couple I know are getting married.
Seven-fifty.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Habib?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Tension. It'll go.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Really?
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
In the casino.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
I might.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Give me 365.
I make it six.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
It didn't go off.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Thanks.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
That's it.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell is dead.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Not now!
No kidding?
Yeah, sure, I understand.
What?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
What're you talkin' about?
Could you give us a moment.
No way.
I got overhead...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
You didn't...
They took my daughter.
I know.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Lauren's not my wife.
I won't be staying.
That would be appropriate, yes.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
No, I meant this.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
With your help.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
You did.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Got a pencil?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Pull the cash.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
We gotta talk.
Does this person have a name?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
You don't.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Shut-up...
For a change.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Whatever... stella.
Yeah.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're what?
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Look, you can have my wallet...
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Like a spear.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You have to do something for me first.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
I am so sorry.
Sure.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Infant Memory Generators.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I think he saved my life.
Follow him where?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
I think about girls a lot.
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Four times... so far.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
Guess who wrote it?
He was a year ahead of us?
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Thank God for bunge cords.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
I just did.
I know.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh, Christ, it's true.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Uh, Gladys?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Is that all?
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
His Excellency's car!
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Yes, sir. 
Well - what is he now?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Yankee Poodle.
I don't want him.
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
Did you shoot the rapids?
I don't wanna work at all.
You told it to me.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Sure.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Give me that again!
You upstart!
No, that wasn't it...
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
What is it?
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Oh no?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes.
My name is...
My... name is...
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Your mother?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Yes. John wants it.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
But, Father, it IS!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Yes.
"The fifth one this week"!
And I thought you said it was something special...
Then let go!
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
REALLY?
Really.
Oh, get it over with.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
I didn't mean to!
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
What?
That's my boy!
You may need a real Berserk.
Who gets killed?
Oh... er... yes...
But...
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
She MUST have a knife or something...
What d'you expect me to do?
You're wasting your time.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Got you!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
Get away, Snorri.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
So did your father...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Helpless...
No, Mother.
I remember.
Yeah, you told me that later.
In the world.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
You should stay.
When?
Tomorrow?
Okay.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Would you get me another, Joely?
Joel, you're a liar.
I don't know.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
What?
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
It's very late.
Is that what you want?
Well, you're married.
Probably.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think she's great.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
It's freezing out here.
Oh, um...
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
You have to stop this!
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Go back to sleep.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Hell no.
Then why did you ask me?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Well, where was Patrick?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
What is Debbie's position?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
I have to go, Julian.
So now you're bummin' around?
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
I heard it.
I'll be all over it.
I'll get him.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
He's crashing...
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Do it.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The Core...!
The "Other Place," what is that...?
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
NOOO!
Locked and cocked.
What is that?
One-four degrees...
We don't have time to fart.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
That's enough!
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
How much oh-two do we have?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
...repeat, we're armed...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
She's not ugly.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
How?
I'm alright. Please.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
No: You're ON FIRE!
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Blockhead started it!
And if he's not...?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
I was talking about us. Working together.
Great minds think alike.
Yes, thanks.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
And reverse the mutations --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Of course.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Totally.
Later.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'll explain everything later.
Well... it's true.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
I know what I look like.
He's my friend, too.
Let's continue.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Really?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
Fascinating.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Do you think that guy's cute?
I can't do that.
I know.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
That little prick.
What do you want?
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
The point sounds fine.
Oh yeah.
Do you really have to go?
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Naked.
Dobermans don't talk.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Jesus! Did I say that?
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Where'd you get this?
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
We're going to get my little girl.
With what just happened upstairs --
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the head?
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Look.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Your brother, huh?
We lived near power lines.
Anybody else?
Oh, no.
He only shot you once.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Get outta here.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
No bullshit.
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
Get something on that.
I'm sure.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Stop her!
I admire your strength.
Well...
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
He's not here.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Fired?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
No?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
...Don't you?
...I see.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
Address?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Well? What'd you think?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
You don't know what you want.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Is that why you did it?
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
I should've known...
What a man!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
I don't know.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
'Golden Boy.'
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
I'll be back.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
No!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
You're not going anywhere!
Yes...?
I see.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
What?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Oh for Christ's...
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
No! No!
It can't be as bad as that.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
No. I draw the line.
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
Quite right!
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Aren't you?
The world is a dizzying place.
I'll have to do better than that.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
Aye, Captain.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
It's a letter to my father.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Is that your diagnosis?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I will protect you.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I finished the boats.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
I had to.
God, but I love that sexy talk.

I call it my shower dream.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
I said new, this is an '90.
So do I just follow you?
The truth hurts.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Died instantly?
Real McCoy.
You won't let him touch her?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Forever together.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Ain't it the truth.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Sight seein'.
Seth, if you were me --
We are?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
He needs our help!
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Sir?  What did he say?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Smoke her.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
California.
What changed?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Get it up!
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
I saw an article...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
Great. See ya then.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Oh yes he will.
Yeah, well...
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
How do you know?
Really? I'd like to find out.
This is not the place...
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Allez, allez!
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They are with me!
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
That's right.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
Sure.
So you're in?
Well good, that's very... nice.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Could they be the miners?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Up.
There is no weather in space.
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
You... know us?
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
Your last name.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
You smiled at me.
But I'm the Commander!
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Turn on the translation circuit.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
You have ten seconds.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
As you wish.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Thanks
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Anything.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Find them.
Get oacK on their tail.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
It is.
While they're strung out?
Same old story.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, general.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Then use rocks!
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Makes you gag.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I understand, George.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Surely you knew this was coming.
I don't want to see your hospital.
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
You know very well who it is that I love.
I'd throw everything away for you.
George, I'm sorry.
Well, we must be who we must be...
I say!
I see...
I reserved a Cadillac.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
About sixty.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
That's the magic number.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Who is this?
Never heard of him.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Get in line, bro.
You have a card in here?
Get him out've here.
What've you got?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You just did.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
He died.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
I'm looking at you.
Wait. How about this?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
Who told you that?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
You thought I was faking?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
You're as bad as Harry...
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
A passenger liner. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Sixty pounds.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Wrong. It's Friday.
No.
What're you crazy?
Oh yeah.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell yeah.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Epps.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Same. Any luck?
If it was a ship she hit.
Wish I could say the same.
I don't know, are we?
Showing you what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps, over.
Right here.
We hit land.
So you killed them?
Of course they did.
You got that right.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Who?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What are you trying to say?
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
I...
No.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Fuck you!
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
It's always closed...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
As always.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
He gives me a total boner!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Go ahead...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
He came into work.
Nothing.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Nothing.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
That's okay...
Who does?
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
That's not even --
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Hey, where are you going?
Later, "Dude".
God, fuck you!
Indian records?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Okay.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Jesus...
For nineteen years...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Jesus, how can you stand her?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
You've never built in Africa.
Yes he is.
And it worked?
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
You never had it.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
Then we agree. 
What if there are complications?-
We have hunted since childhood.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
Possibly.
You mean nobody died?
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Nonsense.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Four should do it.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
I'll supervise.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
You're really good, you know.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
What are you doing up here?
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Did I forget something?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Hello, Venkman.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I hate Jello.
Then let's do it.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
I am Zuul.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Can't you tell me now?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I've got to go now.
Take me now.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Talk to my accountant. 
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Great!  How's it going?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
No, you may not.
That's "Peck!"
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
You talked to Gozer?
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
What do you mean by "seen?"
What do we do now?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
For what purpose?
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
I want that bastard dead!
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
I'm serious.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
He left us at dawn.
I've read of it.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
They fear me.
Well, they die for it!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Of course...
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
I killed too many barbarians.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
Think about it!  Just think about it!
I want nothing to do with the arena.
I'd love some.
No.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Yes, I do.
I'm glad.
I don't understand --
What did she say?
Let me go.
Oh.
But Elaine --
I might.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, I will.
Not exactly.
I want you out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Well I'll hand it to you.
Right.
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
What?
Whatever you say, sir.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Will you take me home?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
What for?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Her portrait?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
On that chair in the hall.
I haven't. No.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
A hanger.
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Don't you?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
There's no risk?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Not exactly.
At college.
I'm curious.
No.
You're not.
I see.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What else?
No -- they don't.
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
To be what?
That has nothing to do with it --
Sir?
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
Great.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
It's Benjamin.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
No -- why? -- should I?
Aren't you?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
For tonight. 
Oh!
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I should like to smoke.
No.
I want to be alone.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really?
No?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll not denounce you.
For Vienna?
Why do you think --
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
I've no luck.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Yes -- but the audience.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
As you will.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Most imposters are --
Telegrams?
No, doctor.
You are ill.
But Doctor --
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, don't go.
No - absinthe.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- you would!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
You pay me.
Movies?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
I understand you perfectly.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Hello!
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
I must go to England -- at once.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
What?
Next week.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
-- We must do something...
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Motherhood.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
No.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You want a drink?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Fair enough.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
And Myra's stuff?
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Uh-huh.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
You called the doctor, huh?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I'll see you when you get home.
Myra, I'm not following this.
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
Open it and find out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
What?
No question, huh?
That don't match either of the victim's.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to protect you from this...
That would work.
Where'd you get it?
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Can't you?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
You're so easy...
Have enough fun for the both of us.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Guess so ...
What if it's Kara?
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Here.  Let me try.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Kara, no!
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Why did you take Jamie?
Samhain.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home is important to a man.
Must have changed that law.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least we found the diamonds.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Haven't got one.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
We got to get another pilot.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!  Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Are you--do you--
Man and boy.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
She met him at college.
He insults him all the time.
No.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Tell me that.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Can't it keep till morning?
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Daughter--I love you very much.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
We thought it was an emergency.
Shouldn't you lie down?
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
A trip, you mean?
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
What then?
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
What are you going to do?
Why not?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
Sneaking in the back door.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
I plan to live one hundred years!
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
You startled me.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
We'll miss you so.
I've got to run!
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
Correct.
I've struck my blow.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Don Quixote.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
You don't know?
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
She did?
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
What happened?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I heard you were looking for me.
Don't worry about it.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
Oh, Paul--
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
Still lives with his mother.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I didn't know that.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
What does he say to do?
He can hardly talk.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You're saying no.
We made the date three months ago.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
She quit this afternoon.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
I wish Paul luck.
Meaning?
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
It's really that bad?
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Phooey.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Yeah.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
We offer...
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Yeah.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Up front?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
You don't drink?
Of Joanne's?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
I care about my daughter.
They were here?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Why can't I meet him now?
On your own land?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's like a stag film.
What do you mean?
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
I just heard. Who is he?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Who told you about this?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Well...
It's a short film.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
Com'on, tell me.
Huh?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Hello.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Then whose name is it registered in?
Because if you are...
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Eh, no.
Your hearse?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Well...
But I don't play anything.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Of course.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Well, why don't you?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
For you.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Does that worry you?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
War is not all black.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
What?
What are you talking...
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
From where??!!
No. It's not.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
I worry about you.
Me?? C'mon --
Is it bad?
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
I can live with that.
-- should go back. Now!
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Not hungry.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Strong.
What?
Hi.
Got her mother's looks.
Julia's my second wife.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Poor baby.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.  Oh yes.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Keep your voice down.
A box?
Hell...
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
Just to your left.
No. I'm not.
In here.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
Are you O.K.?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can I get you anything?
O.K.
No. I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
It's better you see for yourself --
Just soda.
Yeah, why don't I?
I won't be a moment.
I found a room.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Kirsty.
I love you too.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
Of course.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
We're not all frigid.
You gotta be kidding me.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What are you snickering about?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Laura.  Her dad died.
Not really.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Do not get ahead of yourself.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
We work there!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Yeah.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Good weekend?
Fine.
Who's that?
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Well stay for tonight, then.
I should be so lucky.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
You won't like it.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Of course it is.
Never?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
It's me.
I'm not -- hold on...
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
It'll have to be sex, then.
To make you feel better.
Oh, great...
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
WHAT?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
What's happenin'.
How're you holding up?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
I understand completely.
Whiskey.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Good.
I'll call you.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
But you must have --
Thirteen hundred.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
He'd want to know about all this.
Sure.
It's not mine.
Basil the II.
Grave robbers?
Who?
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
Dupont Circle.
He called you "MacLeod".
I'd rather hear yours.
Go home.
You make it all sound so simple.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
A factor of age.
You won't.
Why are you here?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Of bodies.
The inheritance.
I want Taupin.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Yeah.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop!
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
You're a long way from Inverness.
Does it change with me in the room?
Why?
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
Again.  Try again.
Muy Bien!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am not ready for this.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Either you are with me or against me.
I had no choice.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
How did you find me?
It's good to see you, Kahn.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
It doesn't.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
No. My mother.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
How?
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Thanks a lot.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Hello, Hildy!
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
What do you mean by that?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Listen, Walter --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You -- you --
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
No!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
What for?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean?
What tricks would I pull?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Yes. Where is he?
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Huh!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Will you come here?
Murder, uh?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
What's the matter with my brains?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Three bullets! Any good?
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Just -- one -- second!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
I won't.
All right, Judge.
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Very simple, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Shut up, you!
What's from the Governor?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
The what?
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Yeah?
But how do I know...?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
A very fine-looking women.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
What's that?
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
You do it. You're a girl.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
...and four and five...
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Air-raid?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
You need trees for an avenue.
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
What's that?
That's it.
Where to?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
The ideas you get in your head.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
Up to six weeks, I think.
How are we going to cope?
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
How long?
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Yeah.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Hell yeah.
Cat fight, cat fight.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Where ya headed?
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Drive through it!
What I need are some answers. 
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
I hear ya.
Shhhhhh.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
No please, let me sit this one out.
I resign.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
You got to be fucking joking.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
I can't believe...
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Open up the trunk.
What do they call you, sweety?
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Firefly.
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Shit... fuck procedure.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
What.
Excuse me for a second.
It's going famously, son, famously!
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
When you were a little French girl?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Shh.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Stop. Get away.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Unnhh.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Ouch. Yeah?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Shut up, you.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Yes, and...
Nathan!
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.
Flares?
I love you so much.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Nothing. Be right out.
Do you like my new look?
Such as what womanly things?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Ugnh.
Ooka.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
No, why?
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
You want a chaser?
No, I'm fine.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
All I want's the money.
Cut.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
I got drunk.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
For who?
I never saw you do anything else.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Well, I win sometimes.
When do I raise the bet?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I don't want it.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
What time?
Oh no, nothing for me.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Half and a dollar.
Call it.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Fair.
Can I buy you another drink?
I drink.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Give it back to me.
I feel pretty.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Well, what's the matter?
I'm a little tired.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Do you want to go on?
With them?
You want to kill them.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
I surrender --
I guess you could say that.
Why, Dad?
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Good night.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
Why, yes.
Cool.
You have to leave the White House.
David? How'd you get this number?
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
They don't know this.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
And our troops here?
He's doing a good job.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
You sure?
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Where?
Dad was onto something here!
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
Mine, too.
No. You like the way I do things.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
How do you know?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
You do.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
Well, uh...
She talks in her sleep.
My lucky charm.
Try and burn through the ropes.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
Oh.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
You think so?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
There are no stories anymore.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
That was a misunderstanding.
Yes, I understand.
You will go to palace there.
What evil?
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
Oh yeah?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Don't let it curl around you!
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
Willie!
I'm going down.
Go!
What above the curves?!
Try me.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Yes?
Your name is Al...
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Yeah?
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Oh...Gooood!
Why?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Yeah...Who is?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
We'll change your appearance.
The beach?
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
It's sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
This...is not going to work out.
The beautiful one.
Who, me?
How do you know?
She's the toughest to read.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
Is that all?
That's not funny.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
You have to! Quickly!
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Gimme a minute.
About what?
Aren't we all.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
It's a long story.
Sir?
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Enough ROmance.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
I think I've heard of you.
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh...that's okay.
Right.
Who...are you?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
You...him...UST.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
Then who did?
Oh...I can't. Business.
Me still. They left you alone?
You are.
That you're not crazy.
...Naw. Made that up.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
And you, what do you like?
Last night?
No, he didn't do that.
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
What is it?
Get your things.
How?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Hong Kong.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
They asked about you.
Can't you do something?
But you did it. It was you.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Yes.
It will.
Too much.
So we better get started.
What about Al...
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Alright, alright.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Good.
Maybe later.
Oh, I love that stuff.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Hey, Lowell.
How grave?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
"60 Minutes"?
Let me call you back...
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Alright?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
No shit.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Good. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
It's obvious, isn't it?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I'll call them, Lowell.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
No.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
That's not the point.
You greased the rails!
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
So, that's good, right?
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
Absolutely.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
What is it Miles?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
I have a watch.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Hello Marylin.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
That's blackmail.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Marylin.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
So. Now what?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
We do have a man for you.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!
I don't know. I can assume...
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Nothing.
What the fuck...?
No. You're not.
Berry spoons.
HA!
What...?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Yes, sir?
How is she?
"I found a million dollar baby—"
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
We'll go into that some other time.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I might.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
I'm sorry you read it.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
Been sending her meals in regularly?
You talk as if—
Yes, sir.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
But the lady says—
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
What am I going to do now?
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
My ticket?
What are you talking about?
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
What do you mean—starvation?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
To New York?
Okay. Hang on to these.
Oh, Peter— 
What?
Hitch-hiking.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You're an expert, I suppose.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come on—get in.
I love you.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
Well, I am.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Not interested. 
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Bridge washed out—around Dawson.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
I'd put you there myself.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Why?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Yeah. Just babies.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Yeah.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
And then Sunday?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
That's our case!
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
No.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I don't think so, Jim...
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
We need him back.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
If you buy what you read in the paper.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Splendid, love to see them.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Won't forget?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
In his inside coat pocket.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
What's in it?
Beauty products.
Can you do it or not?
You're serious?
Shit.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
With ten thousand? Nine.
Cash poor?
The Delfonics.
Are you?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Bigger?
"American President"
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
And Annette's it for you?
I don't care.
I called you last night.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
What if I've figured a way?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
He say is a surprise.
You planted that shit on me.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
She didn't say.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Si.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
So what happens now?
Do you think I took some of that money?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Yeah.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Baby, I didn't --
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
How the fuck they know that?
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Uh-huh.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Man, I don't like that part.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Sure.
No.
Uh-huh?
This one.
Okay, Lou-is.
Then what?
Okay.
I dunno.
What's your relationship?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Not now, pick me up.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Max Cherry.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Livingston, huh?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
House or apartment?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Was she?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
Winston found you.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
No! Oh God.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
How do you know?
Short? It's ended.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
I am.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
I saw Sarah the other day.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Wiggle your toes.
What?
Louis, you're a life saver.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
I haven't seen her in months.
Yes.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where to?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Did you look around the headboard?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
What do you mean you can see?
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
When was the last time I said a word?
Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Get your clothes off!
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
What kind of man are you?
Remember that.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
I don't believe this.
Let go!
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Sit down, Jake.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm not upset.
Where have they gone?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Please come quietly.
We're not going to hurt you.
What is wrong with you?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm sorry.
Paul Gruneger!
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have a choice!
I don't know. Nothing.
I think I broke my arm.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I don't know!
Suit up.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
You just keep an eye out.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Fuckin A...
Give me a break! What happened?
No you don't!
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
Did you like it?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Small brains make your balls itch?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Maybe she tripped.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
You need to get laid!
Oh shit! There he is!
Am I in there?
Defense droids. I'm on it.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Who's driving the boat?
I almost had 'im.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
I'm going home.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
My kids were on that beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Is anyone having this...?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
I don't think so.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I'm pregnant.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
What?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What, you mean as friends?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
What are you talking about?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Oh, go fly a kite.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
When was this, like '96?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
You're kidding!
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
I actually know this one.
What are you?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Nothing...
This is the baby. Your baby.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Please stop now.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Unfortunately, yes.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Yeah, downtown.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma.
Is it hard to learn?
How'd you meet Early?
Sure.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
...Anything else?
What?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Walter Livesy.
Turkey mostly.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Damn right I do.
The party?
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Funny, very funny.
Lighten up...
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Take your time.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
Wasn't my fault...
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes. Altogether.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Yeah.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
You think?
It is right.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You down with the boost?
Yeah.
Right.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Yep.
He looks like my uncle.
Darcy?
Yeah.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yeah.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Casper, where is he?
Na.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Hold on.
You have?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
Of course I do.
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
No...
I guess so.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
What?
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
When are you gonna be back?
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yeah.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
OK.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No, I need the original note.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Get off me!
Sit down!
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Please... wait.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
He was watching you.
Of course.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Thanks, David.
How long she been dead?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Maybe I already have.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
I want to be the best I can.
About what?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
You sound like my mother.
You mean like in the steam room?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
What?  By attacking me?
No.
I tried again and got through.
Then why are you backing up?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Frank told me.
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Turold's son was to marry her.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?
You will know, in good time.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
Where the spiral begins.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Each to his fate.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
You will not, then?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
To the place where Death lives.
We must try to get horses.
Hand over your dinner.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Naturally.
Would you settle for a boar?
I am Quell.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
And mine goes with you.
You can have half.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
He is the King.
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Yes.
A match for your son, I think.
With an old voice?
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
You had a son.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
...What?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
No.
Too heavy.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Later.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Yes... Twice.
Then...
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
I don't follow.
You don't think I love you?
Why do you polish it?
Then why?
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
That's okay -- really it is.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Not our problem.
That's all right isn't it?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Making the grand total?
By car right?
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
Where am I?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Evening News?
It's yours.
What do you want?
No alcohol?
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Are you serious.
You OK out there?
Right... OK...
No?
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
Where have you been staying?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I'll take that as a no.
Who?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
How?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
You know her?
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
You guys are so sweet!
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Power yoga?
Aside from that.
But maybe it's not what you think.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
What?
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
That's why I think it's time for us to --
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
You got into Harvard Law?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Yes.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
I'd soon die.
Yes?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Don't you care about what's happened?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Aye!  That too.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Blackheart?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
No... but what choice have we?
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Patience, lad.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Never.
Sport, indeed.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
They tricked you.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
And I... love you...
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
I'd be honored.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
We wait.
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
I'm sending you back to Hell!
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I thought I might stop by.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I would have anyway.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Who are all these people?
What's that?
You're a good girl.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
No thanks.
I can use your mom's.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
He's got a standing invitation.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
I flushed it down the toilet.
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Maybe...?
For everything.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
No you don't.
Sit down for a second.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
Nothing.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I still don't know what that means.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I know there's an explanation.
It's okay.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
The garage.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I don't have a phone.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
You're not well.
My stupid back.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Who?
I'll make you something.
Should I?
Sooner than the Fall.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Yeah.
This is what he wants.
Dad said it first.
Yes, it is.
No, nigger.
Better make it a week.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Nothing.
Why didn't you take it?
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
You're soft.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
What do you want, Claude?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
You drew this?!
I'm stuck!
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Let me see that.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Goodnight, Ray.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
'Preciate it. Claude.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
She give you that scar, too?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Understood.
Please, get out of my mind!
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Noon...
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
That's a pretty brassiere.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
What was it called, sir.
You're not saying it's up to me?
No.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
What?
Are you dead?
Yes...
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
We're ready.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
No.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
No.
And?
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
You're sure you don't want to try?
Maybe... sure...
Of course.
How can I?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
That's tomorrow.
Let's see -- how long has it been?
How will they know we're coming?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
...But I still have the choice...?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
What people?
At least it's over...
For as long as I can remember.
Are there any other humans?
Have any other people ever passed through?
No, no, no
All right.
Alive?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Oh my... I'll try.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
What?
Anybody else have a key to the house.
You know what I think?
Over there.
Can I call you?
I'll call you again.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
Okay.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Yes.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Do ya good.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Wake me up when you get home.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
What night?
What job?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I can see that.
Pornos?
Okay.
Who is this?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Yes, sir.
Don't call me brother.
I see.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
I'm thinking.
Yes.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Come on, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
It's unbelievable.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Look, Bob!
When are you going to start?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Thank you.
Goodness, no!
Who, for instance?
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Centuries.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Well, is it?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Right, Bob.
Yes, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What do you mean if we should get out?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Oh, George . . .
You're wrong, George.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
hope you'll forgive me for—
Thank you.
Struggling, why?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Please don't go.
The hell were you thinking?
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
It'll make sense later?
Actually, sir--
Sir, you can't just--
We wear black.
Right.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
There's a god damn good reason.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
I think that's what's happening...
For how long?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Fine.  Good.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Oh shit!
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Is it now?
They're inside.
Forget that guy --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
We won't let them.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Everybody runs.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
No doubt.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Everybody runs.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Run the subscription list...
Georgetown.
Now look at him...
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Oh... Hi, John.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I need your help.
She's a precog?
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I guess that's all of it.
Sean --
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
Hold your breath, Dad...
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me!
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
You said they're destroyed.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Where are you?
Wait, just a second...
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
I wanna kill my boss.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
Two?
None.  This was arranged.
Knott!
I forgot my glasses.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
No thank you.
When served warm --
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
Where's the place to go tonight?
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
Should I fuck him?
Come on. Let's go.
Bullshit.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
No.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Mommy's not home?
Where were you?
Who's watching the baby?
Shhh. He'll hear you.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Excuse --
Yeah.
Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.
That's it.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Pshhh...
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Yeah. Sorry.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Well, this is the corner.
Yeah.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Can you check?
What about boxing?
How am I being shitty?
I got no idea.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
He didn't say we need guns.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
What are we delivering?
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
I don't know.
What's the movie?
Nah, don't bother --
No. Look. There.
Great. On my fucking room.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Oh really. Why's that?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Fuck this.
You fucking nuts?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Where do you live?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
You really in trouble?
No, really, mate?
Word.
Yeah.
You'll love it.
So you're our own private guy?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yes.
Goodbye.
But, Max --
Yes, sir.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
Man's rep travels.
Solid, daddy.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Man, what do you want?
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
She ate.
I can handle it.
What have you set your mind to?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
We need you too!
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm tired of praying.
Let's get out of this cold.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Is my family here yet?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Yes, sir, I did.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
I mean it's late, baby.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
How long has this been going on?
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
No.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
So you are going to talk me to death.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
I show, you give me the information?
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[The what?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Her life for your life.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
It's loaded.
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
I'm here.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Nothing wrong.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
I'm a bargain.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
But why not?
You don't drink like you used to.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Then don't come.
What was her name?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
That's what friends do.
I can take care of myself.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Yeah, sure.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
I been looking all over for you!
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Yes, I know.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Are you kidding?
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
You gonna get married.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Sure.
What, Ma?
Hiya, Ralph...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Sure, sure.
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Duke Forrest.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
Be right with you.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
I have a tent to myself.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I can't... couldn't.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I found a doner.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
It's possible
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
It isn't always this rough?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
You think he won't.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They missed the boat.
The one and only.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Damn.
I used to throw the javelin.
Arterial silk.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Uh-huh.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
The letter from John Doe.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Well, maybe you're right.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
That's—
Where's Connell?
What?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Naw.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
A what?
A gag. A gag!
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Yes. Sure.
No.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Did you write it—or didn't you?
She isn't?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Good night, John.
That's too bad.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
Okay.
Shh!
What?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Clarence Teal.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
You can't help me, man.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I need to get something straight first.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Roper...
Only at the very end.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
I don't gamble.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
So what do I say to this guy?
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
What's the first commandment?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
I do.
Fine.
To run late!
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
As a matter of fact, I do.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
...the hell are you talking about?
SHIT!
Your concern is heartwarming.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
I can't do that.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Because I took it out of your memory.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Dream?!
And down here --
Unfinished business.
-- He will.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
It's not used for anything.
That's right.
To hide the evidence.
Not you.  A copy.
There was no other choice.
Why not?
Try me.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Program name?
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.

WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
GO IVAN!!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Charlie Luciano.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Shane was a friend of yours?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
For being a bootlegger?
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
What the fuck does that mean?
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
That's why I'm here.
I don't fuck my partners.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
So change it.
Shuddup.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Yeah...before your time.
Olive or eyeball?
<u>Why</u>??
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Bend over?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Death! Thank you!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<i></i> In what way?
Got a doctor on duty.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
I don't think so.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
When'd you get in?
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
Behind the books.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You got worms.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
That's taking place outside now.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Yeah. Funny--
Any time.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Have *you*?
Do we *have* to?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Oh! Go away.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What stuff?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Certainly. Step right in.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
No, Jeff--please--!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Jefferson--
The man downstairs said number--
Most natural thing in the world!
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Committee, huh?
Try sitting down.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
No!
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Great.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Thanks a lot.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Are you drunk?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
A camp! Well!
Splendid.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Well--I can *manage*--
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
I know that.
Susan!
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
You won't stand for it?
You can't say *that* to--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
That depends on what they see.
Oh, that—
What did you mean by that?
He did? I play the tuba—
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I don't blame you.
No. It's nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Running away is no solution.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Yes, sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Yes, sir.
This is outrageous!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
All set.
Yeah?
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Buffer?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Why should you?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Shut up!
Me?!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Ja.
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Binge?
Where is your farm?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Oh, I do too, sir.
You try it.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Could you come with me please?
A friend?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
...And I from Phyllis.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
Mr. Gilroy --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
What are they?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
You're right, as usual. See you.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
What do you mean?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Maybe you'll catch it.
I've offended you!
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Either one.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you wait for me?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
He agreed?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
I've got three big ones.
Don't you like this?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yep.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
A doll?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
It's not?
Just you.
But look at me now...
Things got a lot worse.
No... no training.
What?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Altar boys?
You always did have more balls than brains.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Oh yes, always.
Intestines.
Exactly --
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
What did you do to him!?
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
And what did he say?
What are you doing here?
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You swear?
If you call that a kiss.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
I have no choice.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
I think you found something.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Awfully.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Me, too.
Hello?
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
Frankenstein!
Me.
You're a spy.
I saw him walk you home.
Roy.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
Have you always lived here?
It's home.
Monica, where are you?
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
SO WHAT?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
I'll drive.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Or flowers.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Please...
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
There are none here.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Bertrand, sire.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Ah-hh, no.
I see...
My God, what a fire!
The first reports came in at about ten.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
Thank you.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You must not act impetuously.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Yes.
Were any of them married?
I will never forgive you.
Promises mean nothing.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Yes.
But you will not... be safe...
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
There's probably some explanation.
Certainly.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
What are you talking about?
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
What?
What was there to tell?
I know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
What happen?
Not me.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Ain't no windows in here.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
What about me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Come on.
Yeah, pops!
Peace out, Craig.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
You damn right that's the big one.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I don't know.
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
What?!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I can't feel my legs no more.
I don't know.
I got my mase.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Oh, yeah?
That's right.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Same to you.
Yes, I'm listening.
How did you see us kiss?
Right.
I'm just an accountant.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Keep your eyes peeled.
What about them?
I kill her anyway.
Only you.
You're wasting time.
What gives?
No, Ben.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Not even her?
How's your sister Pearl?
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
Walt!
All to pieces!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
There's something else.
You better not sing that song.
Sshhh...
Yes, I reckon that's it.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
He ain't my Dad.
No. No.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Don't you believe me?
Yonder.
How old are you?
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Where's the money hid.
Can I have this?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
How'do.
She took them kids with her?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
How you plan to do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Deal.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
It's from Paris.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
What do you wear in the morning?
You want this?
That's another thing... it's spring.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
What do you mean they might -- they will!
How many families live here with you?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Yes, Comrade?
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Very well, Your Highness.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Yes.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
A day.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Yes, monsieur.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Private.
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
Suppress it.
So that is your house?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Yes.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Just smile.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
I wish they had never met.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
No.
Yes.
I don't think so.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
What, darling?
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
No speech?
Yes... a little white house.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
Let's turn on the radio.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Who cried that one?
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Good morning, Swana.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Oh, yes.
You haven't seen her yet?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
How do you do?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
What is this, Swana?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Please... sit down.
Raw carrots and beets.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
What?
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
No, sir.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
... go on.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
For what?!
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
That's right ...
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Fucking hell.
All right.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Sir?
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Let him finish, Bob.
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Mr. Castro.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
I beg your pardon --
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Free, if you're the president.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
Maybe I am.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
Proud?
Yes, yes.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
And then you'll be happy?
You personally?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I am older.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
No I ain't.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
It could be.
The old boy shot by the highway?
That's very linear Sheriff.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
You figure him for a dope runner?
Gun out and up.
Wasn't no bullet.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir. It was punched out.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
How's that, Sheriff?
I never do.
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
To your husband.
That'll be the day.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Llewelyn --
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right.
What's that.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
Screwgie.
I don't need to talk to you.
All right.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Yessir.
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
Well enough.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Not any way.
I'm retired.
So was I.
What product.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
I don't know. American citizens.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
No, I didn't have to.
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Umm, I don't think that...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Yes, ma'am.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Maroon.  I stole it.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Yes, she is.
You told me that two hours ago.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
I have... did it sound that bad?
George...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
How many men have I talked to?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
HE IS REAL!!
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Your husband?!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Now, that's really stupid.
IT SURE IS!!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Joyce was screwing Del.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
What the hell's the matter with you?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
We know that...
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
I SAID FORGET IT!
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Four hundred, Delmar.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh, okay.
Okay, Pappy.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Suckin' away.
Helluva awgazation.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Powas p'suasion.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
That's right, honey.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Don't I know it.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Aw, that's all right.
But... but...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
I am. Hur you?
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Buyin' nipples!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Why?
Nobody. It just came to me.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Pity you don't have the character.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
No, sir.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yes I do!
Is your brother a flyer?
Yeah.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
I'm a little late, that's all.
Sid, there's no baby.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Yeah... Mmmm...
And you turned him down??
Yeah? Why're you here?
There's always a choice.
You're better than candy.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
That's okay. I'm used to it.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
That's brilliant.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
There is not one thing funny here.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Yes.
I can't just...
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Are you gonna open the safe?
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
They're not supposed to be here!
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
I did.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
No ball, kid.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
The hell we are.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
Open the door.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
No.
Close it!
I'm sorry.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Not an option.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
I don't know. Look around man.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Just a kid.
Just the legit shit.
What?
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
You couldn't have known.
I know that.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
With a lace table cloth?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
I will do so as soon as possible.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
What officers?
Not yet.  What happened?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Yes...  ... father.
Flanking riders?
No...
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Name five hundred.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Put them away.
Quiet.
Well...I guess not.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
I will. Come and kiss me.
For a little while.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
You believe in it.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Sure.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
But--
You want to rest a bit before you start?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Your cairn.
Yes.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
What?
Well...a touch of the flu...
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Jesus, the road!
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Did you see his shirt?
I'm sure.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
She.  Goes.  Free.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
Or you could surrender.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Very well.
Did you, now?
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
It's a pirate medallion.
Boy overboard!
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.
I know where your heart truly lies.
-- then we never would have met.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
I'll lead them away.
Jack!
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
Still --
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
But --
Have you found Dr. Bright?
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Considering what?
What I asked you earlier?
If you loved me like I loved you?
The nanobot is gone.
The trunk.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Well, you got another problem.
What are you going to do?
You're afraid of him.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
Right.  You predicted it.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Got it.
What do these replicators do to people?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Isn't it already too late then?
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
No problem.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
Yes.
The same thing I suppose.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Oh yes you are!
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
Exactly.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Now let's get this settled—
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Mother!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Huh?
Is that so?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
No!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Quite so. Quite.
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
I didn't run away.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
What do you know about Conrad?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Here you are.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
No.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Surely, come right in.
Why—
Get out of here.
I beg your pardon?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Now the lady said you may go—
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
I just putter.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
That's all I wanted to know!
Thanks.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
What do you mean?
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Oh, George ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I was in a bowling-alley.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Lover's Lane!
I think ... I might be ill ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Pleasantville Marathon?
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
What do you mean?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
... Lover's Lane?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Hunh?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
... Like Prince Charming.
McIntire's.
Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
I can't.
NOW!
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I'm going to leave now.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
I'm so glad you're here.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Just listen to me ...
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
No, that's not it.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Yes, I'll be there.
And what was this?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Yes.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I'm going to work.
Me?
Yeah.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
We got disconnected before....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
It's terrible, no.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah, no, I see --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....yeah....
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What happened?
Yeah.
I don't know.
This is Lena.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
What do you mean?
It's Barry.
Yes.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Where you married?
Yeah......yeah.....
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
...what...?
This is funny.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
What's that for?
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I didn't know you had a sister?
....I have seven.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
It takes time to process --
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
...I'll tell you later.
Where you goin?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What?
I'm sorry.
Yes. Sorry.
Yes I am.
You can't be late.
I won't.
Seriously.
Seriously.
It's fine.
Bye, Barry.
Ok.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Yes, Abbe?
By whom? The Marquis?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
Don't be so sure.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
That's enough.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And --?
What could cause a tincture like this?
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Houdini mice.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Mm.
But I am That's the killer, honey.
And director.
So I've been told.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
You know that can't happen.
Bel Air is restricted.
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
There's nothing to explain
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
Yes?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
I wanna see the picture today
Can I talk to Hearst?
Not for me.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Like a bug.
Oh Christ
Please don't say this.
Sorry to disappoint.
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Why her?
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Very generous
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Yes
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Well it' s all you've got !
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Go 'head.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What do you mean, "you"?
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Now take your panties off.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Huh?
Yeah, what?
I never noticed his face.
Positive.
You did?
Why don't you just call him up?
I don't know.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Jefferies?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
That's what they call a family problem.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Who left -- where?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Mrs. Thorwald.
All the things I hate.
Like an old hambone?
Where'd they take Lisa?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Wrong day?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Something wrong?
No.
Lisa Fremont.
That's normal.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
He and his wife splitting up?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
Now wait a minute --
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Not too active.
Only because it's expected of her.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Yeah.
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
I don't know.
Thinking about Thorwald?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Too close.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Your name?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
Give me some dirt.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Well, now--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
You're absolutely right!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Look--just relax, will you?
Open it.
Well maybe she better start.
Hi there.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
What's a chickie-run?
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Judy.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
They like you.  Okay?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Oh.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
What a relief!
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
That one?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
-- till he fucked his parole --
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
I don't think it's negative five.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
NICK!
You sold him out.
Nick, what are you --
...maybe I die for Nick...
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
You saved me.
No.
Well. I'm going home.
Yeah. That's love.
Who wouldn't.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You what...
But you were saying you were...
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
...never... tried...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No, Gabriel... no...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Hi, Nick.
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Aw, Rudy.
Ash... Ashley...
...for Christmas...
She set them up. All of them.
Well...sorry...
Now where were we?
Yes.
Bullshit.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
...What bar?
How can you tell?
A little.
The Brewers.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
What?
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Sure.
How is he?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Down to my car.
It's a surprise.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You don't believe in tipping?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Why not?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
That was the plan, we meet here.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what is it?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
If we don't, he'll die.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
And one of 'em is sick.
You can stay here if you like.
I'll make the soap myself.
Maybe it's better that way.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Like what?
Yes.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Why?
I won't again.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
Kind of sore.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Three men on matched roans?
What's there to be fair about?
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Don't act so -- crazy.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
It isn't that --
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
He certainly could. About a month.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Up the trail.
Because there's a man I want to see.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
No. We're not stayin' --
Then I know my alphabet.
Sure.
Steve --
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Open chest!!!
Let's get outta here.
Hugh Kane.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Not in a thousand years.
Made you say it!
Alright, let's take a vote...
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Gear. You know, clothing.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
The keys. She took the keys.
Hi.
And sexy.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Father, come in, please.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
My holy water.
No, I'm fine.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Looks good, Mom!
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Oooohhhh.
Ooohhhh!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Who is this?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
It's sugarless.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Right here!
Certainly not!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Listen ——
Drink.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
"The Dante?"
Nothing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Weren't you afraid?
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
I don't know.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I won't get lonely.
But you're always at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -— you're off to work.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
What a peculiar question.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
It might have.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
It seems right to us.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
She's very beautiful.
Please.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
You play an instrument?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
How do you mean?
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
Do you want me to?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
I can see that. What are they?
You went out with her?
Not really.
Can we look at one?
I know.
Don't you want to make one?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Why not?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Why not?
No.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
What?
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
You bitch. I knew it.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Yeah, I know.
Radon leakage?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't want to discuss it.
Thirty-two dollars.
No.
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
So will you, someday.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
That's all.
Yes.
Whichever you prefer.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
I'd like to make another tape.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Who said I was jealous?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Afraid of getting caught?
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
I like the way he dresses.
Right.
Why not?
How about straightening up the living room?
It'll just be me.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
He said immediately.
He'll be really mad.
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
No, nothing.
He sounded fine.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
NIGHT NIGHT
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Who trusts experts?
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Absolutely correct.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Fast!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
WHAT A JOKE...
CRIMINAL
No.
We're not confused.
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Gary.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Is it chicken?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Anything I'd know?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
What?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Now.
Then it's a good thing.
Pour us a couple.
You know her?
She is very hot.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Can you give me some room here?
Is what the money thing?
It's private.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Let me use your phone.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Huh. Let me think.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Yeah.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Quite a week.
What the fuck!
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
See you.
Try it.
Yeah, I know.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good. So did I.
Goodnight, Miles.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes it was.
Yes.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
We have to go in the basement.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Me too.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't call me Father.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Sounds like a virus.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
You'll lose the signal!
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
All right then.  Let's go.
That's why I'm here.
You must have known that before you came.
I already did that.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Where's Turley?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
Never will again.
Believe it.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
Good-bye, Paden.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
So-called?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I'm not --  He's not.
Good-bye.
Excuse us.
Please.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
She'll drive herself.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
You look so, so...
What I do to Simone?
Is that a problem?
How about the nudity?
Clyde.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I'm sorry.
You saw that?
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I do okay.  How about you?
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
This should take care of Mother.
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Dr. Crowe.
No.
If it's okay with you?
You mean aneurysm.
Look over there.
You hate him?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Who me?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Cats?
Never mind.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
You believe now?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Lots of things.
Don't get mad.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Who!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Chuck E. who?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
See?
Slut.
Not according to these.
...You any good with those?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Sounds familiar.
Hey. Fuck you.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
"And a slash-slash there --"
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I'll be fine here.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
The audience!
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
He's right. You were behind.
Wait a minute --
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Listen to me --
Suzie --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Sorry.
What?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
My present?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
They're both a challenge.
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
See ya, Kate.
Another time.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Can a pig whistle?
What does the old Timex say?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
I hate to say it...
What's that, pardner?
Go breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
About one to five years worth.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, sir.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
You have a butler working that floor?
And who has access to that floor?
Maybe.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
No.
Ww... uh...
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
That's not possible. I told you.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
Then what --
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Without peer?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...So you made another deal?
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
You got clicks, anything?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No shit.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
You're not Gibarian...
That's fantastic.
How quickly?
He's dead.
He'll let me in.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
How much sleep?
Shut up.
What was it?
Told you what?
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
Just get him to stop.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Why?
To calm my anxiety.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
You don't love me.
No.  I love you.
Those are dreams.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
You said he was dead.
You're lying.
Yes, you are --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
When?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
We want to talk freely.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Can we go then?
I got money.
Not too sure about that.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
But "nice".
Very nice.
Open the door, will you?
Stop being nuts!
What do you want to do?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Oh that thing in Queens.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
I'm not saying it's your fault.
No.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
No, I need'm now!
Be happy.  He's good at this.
I asked for the man in charge...
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
How about dinner tonight?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Some things you should say anyway.
I hate--
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
I think I'd like that.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Use a fork.
Let's talk in the hall.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Really, Professor, I--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Like it?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Just drop me off here.
We did not.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Static!
Roger.
That'll do.
In this barracks?
Yeah. Security.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
That's right.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Which one of you is what?
Sefton!
What are the chances busting out of here?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
It's a mouse trap.
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
Let me go!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
You want to go?
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Any objections, men?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Borscht?
We did it.
Anybody cover?
You told them, Hoffy.
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
What did you say?
I'll kill you for that!
December seventh, forty-one.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
HoS qorDu. 
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Population?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
All hands, brace for impact!
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Please, I insist.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
And what would that be, sir?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Aye.
What's normal?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Is there a problem?
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Thank you.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
What did you see, Chekov?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Logic indicates that is the case.
I don't understand.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
He asked you not to grieve...
... Spock...
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
How is that...?
That's all you have to say?
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
From yourself, Admiral.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I can hardly see --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
He's on a build up to detonation!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I didn't expect anything.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Raise the shields...
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Scotty, let's have it.
Not at present.
I am understandably curious.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
I would not presume to debate you.
Or the one.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Steady as you go...
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Very well.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Who?
Erased...
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Understood, sir.
Visual.
Scotty!
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
I'll try, Captain.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Honors -- hup!
Aye, sir.
Humans make illogical decisions...
... They do, indeed.
Fine. Just fine.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
-- That's the general idea.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Cramps.
Come on, Pavel...
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
We're just -- observing.
Fundoscopic examination --
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
I do not know your name.
I'm wery sorry, but --
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Here... In the park?
But Kirk...
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Explain.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
For example?
Yes?
I see.
I cannot tell a lie.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
How will playing cards help?
... Aye sir...?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Mr. Sulu?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
No power to the bay doors.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
If you'll follow me, Professor --
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
There are caves in those mountains.
Perhaps, that is true.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
The artificial lifeform was right?
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
How about a passive radiation scan?
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Eject the core.
The purpose being...?
Commander Riker...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Sir?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Say the greeting again...
Was I doing something to your neck?
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Absolutely.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I look forward to reading your report.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
Bag him.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Yes, he is.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Friends from Cornell...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Destroy the deflector dish.
Just a little queasy...
Emergency override!
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Riker here.
The charge is murder.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Can you - ?
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
I'm not sure how to take that.
You feign ignorance?
He just tried to save him!
Take them away.
Yes...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Kronos, sir?
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
They're dying.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
So, that's it..
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Not yet... Section 4236...
... is to trust him.
I believe you. Please...
You can't prove any of this...
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
To happy endings.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
How can you be sure?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Why is it moving?
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Thank you, Commander.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
Understood.
If you don't mind.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
She's a predator.
I have dissolved the Senate.
New worlds.
We are.
You know that's not possible.
But you want to.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Seven minutes.
You heard me.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
I don't see anything.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Sure.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
We should have. Let me see.
What do you do?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Coupons.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
No.
I want to try it.
Horses.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
Yes.
You want this ticket?
No.
Yes?
Please stay.
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I understand.
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Horses.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I know how to gamble now.
Goodbye.
I don't know where he is.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Fly.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm already hurting.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Tell me.
What kind of things exactly?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Top ten.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Sorry.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Well... the guy's fucked up.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your existence.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Define illegal.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Jesus, Mace!
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
You never told me.
Yeah.  We did.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Anybody talk to the press?
What does the Manager say?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Hi. What's in the case?
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You're a... you're sick.
Yes.
What kind?
What's with the eyelids?
Smarter than us.
Please.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Was?"
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
How long have you been downtown?
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
All the same killer?
I...
So you went underground?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Yeah.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
[Follow me.]
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[You tell me.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
I don't...
350 miles.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
You've been through worse.
I don't know about that.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Shuddup.
What kind of car do you drive?
I like quiche.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
You haven't told then, huh?
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Well that sucks.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I didn't want to say anything.
I'll give you an eight. 
Sounds more like Aids...
Classy.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Make someone bleed.
So, what? Eleven?
Rejected?
...People get carjacked...
What are they doing here?
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
We're going to Vegas.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
That's not cool.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
She likes you.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No!
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't notice.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Yes. 
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
You understand him better than anyone.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Good.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
How do you know I come from America?
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
How is your father?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
I won't panic.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
Probably a year...
I do renounce him.
Thanks.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Do you recognize my voice?
I'll come down.
It's vile.
Okay, darling.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
No, still here.
Sure.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
Sure. I love Venice.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
Ripley's plans.
Really? To Italy?
How?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What evening?
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Sure.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Which is?
Randall.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I'll take them both.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
My name is Travis.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Oh. Who was that again?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
Hello, Betsy.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Just what?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
For a fee.
One-Ball McCall?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
No.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Damn straight.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I'm hip.
O.K., cowboy.
Thanks.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
It's all I could think of.
What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
That always used to work.
Well... where can we go?
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
What did... what did I want to be?
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Yes, sir.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Nine and-a-half years...
Anybody take it?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
What do you mean?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Yeah... me too.
Oh...
That you got let go.
Got any money?
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Yes.
Lovebirds.
Thank you.
All right. 
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then what was it?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Thank you.
I need her exact name, you see.
Yes?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
It's nothing.
What happened?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes, Mother.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What good will they do?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
When?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
We... we went to school together. College.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
I'm sure.
Famished.
His wife changed the channel.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
No.
But you tore it up.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It's an uprising.
Hear!
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
We've got to get Cathy.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
You must be exhausted.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
Then let's go. Now!
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Where can I find him?
Come in, boy -- come in.
Well? And are you not a good student?
But Richardson?
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Why don't you do it then?
No.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
I'll get him.
Aye.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
You sent them. I had no choice.
I think we should get some support?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Good thing in a situation like this.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
I don't want to see!
You know.
Good for you. You do know something.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Professor Barnhardt.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Yes, I have!
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure, but--
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
What about him?
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I was.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
Yeah.
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
What?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Good!
Whatcha doin' over here?
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
What's that smell?
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Soon.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
No, I'm not...
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
He doesn't walk all over me.
Now you and David...
When?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Because I love you...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Maybe.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Don't walk behind me.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
We got morphine, don't we.
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
All in Norwegian.
Nothing we can do about that.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
A serum test possibly.
I'll put this right through your head.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Why?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
The Hall of Books.
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
It frightens you.
Yes...
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
End...?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I'll never forget this.
Alexander.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Because...
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Sorry... I was distracted.
You're getting warmer.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Got here as soon as I could.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I have something for you...
Do you know you were humming?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
I live with it every minute of every day.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Do you find her?
That's absurd --
His home.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Every night.
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
You lost someone.
Is it?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Go back to your own time?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
That'll be all.
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
No, you're safe --
But... what about Starks?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Just do it.
[Beat] What's your name?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
Yeah.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
I might not be able to.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I guess I'd ask you why.
I could try to...make it stop.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
This has nothing to do with that.
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
You told me this was how it happened.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
The Jacket.
Why?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Sure.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
How?
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
What?
Why?
In the leg.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Yes, sir.  I know.
That's certainly possible.
Right.  Where are they?
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I always knew that.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Who did it?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
Maybe.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I don't know.  I won't be.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Litterbug.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
What little dogs?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
What'd I say again?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Eeuww.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can change our names.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Oh.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Nah.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Huh? But why did Healy?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
No.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
People get hurt that way.
Out getting coffee.
Thanks.
Ahh.
Thanks.
Pat Healy.
I work with retards.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Well, I'll see ya.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Jai alai?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
How do you guarantee that?
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Ah, she's okay.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Healy.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
The prom -- you going?
Hi, Mary.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Yeah?
You're Woogie?
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Eh.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
What's gotten into you?
Something your father would've come up with.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
What does the letter say?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Cuba.
Says what, Kenny?
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Yeah.
Damn right I'm scared.
I don't know. I don't know.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Jesus Christ...
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Hey. Nice tie.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
It ain't Geronimo.
Who are you?
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Who the fuck is he?
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
Beats the hell outta me.
Good.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
Bullshit.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
That's a big comfort to me.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
How did you know this was my car?
What would?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Used to what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
That's true. What are you?
You ever think about killing another human being?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
I'm still second best.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
What?
Your watch.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir!
YEAH, COUGAR?
Let's hope you're right!
You.
What is?
What?  What is it?
No! Now we're inverted!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Just relax.
Well what?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Mister to you.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Come on, relax...
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I've had enough...for now.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
I didn't ruin her.
GOT 'EM.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
So have I.
Didn't everybody?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
A good man. Good flyer.
Is that how you remember it?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
My wife's house.
Or you can quit.
Over there man.
And you get a kickback.
Identification?
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
At Rekall.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Any news of Quaid?
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
I don't know.
Well don't.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Up!
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened.  You got it.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Doug...
The hell you're not.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
What's in the two week package?
I love you.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
It's just up ahead.
I gave you?
No problem.
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
You're really leaving, huh?
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Why?
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
That's the plan.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
I'll go with that plan.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Sons of bitches!
I think we wait right here.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Yeah...but no ties.
The con...!  Oh my God.
What?
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
He was your snitch.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Correct.
So noted.
"We"?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
Ah.
Not at all --
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!
Right. You're right.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
I feel much better now.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Neither.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
I don't need sleep!
I killed the motherfucker.
About Chinatown. What went down.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
Shouldn't one of us...?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
A woman.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Don't get funny with me again.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Out back in our morgue.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
An old woman and her grandson.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
Where's Hap?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
That's good.
I'll get my kit.
Faulty wiring.
When?
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Dancing.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
WE got it back, that's all.
I can't help you there.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Maybe.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I already made you two tapes.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
A special friend?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Very good.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Gruber...
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
...I was one of a group of...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Tell me one?
That's what I'd planned to...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Her doctors killed her.
I understand.
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Listen to me, fella...
The TV didn't work.
And what are you? A cop?
Really. How wonderful for you.
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
Yes.
And what makes you so tough?
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Kathy Price.
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked?
...I know. I went...
Yes. Yes, I have.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
Don't touch anything.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
What?
No.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
What difference can that make...? All right...
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I just saw her.
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
...of the procedures...
Like...ah...
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
Don't let's lose each other.
Have you got a pocket compass?
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
Looks like the fishing was good.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I don't follow.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
No.
No...
Oh my God...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Not sleepy.
A story?
Fred Krueger did it.
The car's no there yet?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
I just can't.
They wouldn't let me...
My child?  No...but...
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Yes sir.
No, I can't.
To take a piss.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Anonymous.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Maybe it's an air raid.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
I can't make it out?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Oh, really?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
What's that?
I'm not staying out here.
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
Yes, I was.
What makes you so sure it was one?
May I ask you something?
I am accountable.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Fuck me.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
When did you talk to Lula?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Come here.
I couldn't say, which one?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
How's that?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
This 'bout the fifth time?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
She got me an abortion...
What's that, peanut?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
So?
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
You mean like pedal pushers?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Who do?
Where?
Uh huh.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
No radio or TV...
Fan works.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Lead the way.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
SAILOR!!!!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I asked you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Where we goin'?
What?...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Isn't she?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
So sensitive.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Such as.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
The last month maybe.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Really? That's remarkable.
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
I've got tenure.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
That's a big book you're writing.
But... ?
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Colon cancer.
Where's that?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
Kinship.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I never said that.
What would you call them then?
Even if I end up going to jail....
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
Oh. Well. I...
But where? I need the street.
No, it's not that, it's...
I got the message you called.
I'm pregnant.
Neither do I.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
And the jacket?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
I said it didn't sound like you.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Does he still love you?
Why yes. How did you know?
I... I...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
I was thinking of you.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Why did you come here, Grady?
That's all right. We'll find him.
Beautiful. How's business?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Nothing.
In that birch tree is a nest.
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I would.
I could get a search warrant.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
I was asleep.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
What's with the boxes?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
'Fraid not.
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Robin?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
It's all the same.
Why not?
It's okay.
Forget it.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Have to talk about something.
Do you think you're crazy?
You couldn't say.
Do you know what "normal" is?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where are you?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
It's fucking freezing out here.
People without cars.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
No you're not.
I thought I'd stay the night.
I suffer from insomnia.
You don't really --
I was always the one seduced.
Why not tell me now?
No you don't.
Are you serious?
Us seeing each other.
Move in with me.
What's your fucking problem?
Piece of cake, baby.
Where're you?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Do we just leave him there?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
You watch yourself.
Give me that!!
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
We'll send the raft back to you.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Are you joking?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
That's why I asked you...
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Who's moving?
Yes, yes, of course.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Why don't you try?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Yes.
Why?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Who told you this?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Who?
They were stained.
Who?
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Yes.
Agnes, how are babies born?
What do you mean?
No.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
I was a mistake.
Yes?
That you're a mistake?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Who am I?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Of what?
I had a baby.
Why were you afraid?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
What else?
A crucifix.
Yes.
She'd seen him too.
Yes.
Yes.
When?
No!
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
... Thank you.
I can beat that.
None as far as I know.
Why do you think that?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And what happened?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
Not simple, no.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What?
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Oh, dear God.
I know you don't.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
You just said...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Stupid woman... and that's all?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Yes I do.
Then let's begin.
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Then she's a liar.
Eh?
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
The cards... you're bank.
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
I see you go to the night court.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Grotty?
We do.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
What?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Lip reading.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Foreign devil ...
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
No.
We were going to do it.
I would have said so.
Temper! Temper!
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
What?
Nerves.
Clever.  George.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Where the hell are we?
What's the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
Then take her down.
Receiving.
No, you'll follow me.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
What do you mean?
Shit...
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Here, let me try.
Well we better do something.
Right. 
How does he breathe?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
<u>How</u>?
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
We're not going anywhere.
How many?
Hey!  what about the film?
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Is that its mouth?
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
Even simple.
What did it do to you?
Kill me...
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Sure.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Appreciate that.
Compensate!
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
What do you mean?
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I call myself Phoebe.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Eddie what?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I can't believe my ears...
Yes, Addison.
I don't think I'm going.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
She may be later than you think...
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Of course I knew.
Was she that bad?
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Huh?
Right here. A minute ago.
Everything... everything's so funny...
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
I love you too. Good night, darling-
That never stopped you before.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Nothing, really...
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
What's all over?
I must have frightened her away.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
Groom.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Just wondered what?
Why.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
No thanks, Birdie.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
She's loyal and efficient-
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
I've heard of them.
Subway.
How long does it take?
I don't care if I never get home.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I wish I could believe that.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Isn't that what they always say?
With tears.
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
That was way back...
When you do, let me in on it.
I will.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I have no intention of having an accident!
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Would you?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Answer my question!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--no way--
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
About the past year.
--see?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
Sure.
'68.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--jeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Tell that to Muskie.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
--Deep Throat?--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
You can't believe that.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
Haldeman.  Right?
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
Neither will I.
Because I want to.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
That's nice.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
This isn't any better, Chris.
Sure.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Holy shit!
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Michelle.
I told you.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
C-Span?
Well...uh...
For me?
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
You got in.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yeah.
It did.
What?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
That's the spirit.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Stifler!!
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
I don't know... Surprise me.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
So... you feel okay now?
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
I'll be right back. Stay put.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
What...?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Before the coma!
Oh shit... No...
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I know, but I had to because . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
You'll laugh.
Poor Meetoo!
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
What happened to your parents?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
No!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Anya... where are we?
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Run, Anya -  go...
No. Empress, you --
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I had nothing to do with it!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
It's okay.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Alvy.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Oh, sorry.
Duane?
Yeah?
And we'll digest our food better.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
You followed me!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
G-go on, I'm interested.
M'hm.
Sinatra?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Life. I said, "life."
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Very big spider.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but it's real close.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Oh!
Can I confess something?
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
You have a raccoon?
Oh, do yuh?
Forget it, Max.
You'll total the whole car.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
No.
We're going to take them to the airport.
No, no, no, not at all.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Was it a contractor?
Would it make a difference?
Absolutely.
No, what?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
It's not going to come up.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Just did.  Jealous?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Leave us alone right now.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Beats a lawsuit.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Really?
Truce?
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
You changed your mind.
I know.
I don't want to go tonight.
That's under lock and key.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Will you make love with me?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
I meant Sally.
And Ryan works at home.
Scout's honor.
We're way past inappropriate.
Sally!!!!
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
He always has two or three going...
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
I don't need a drug.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
No, never.
Do you need anything else?
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Not something new.
You're my best friend.
You don't need to thank me.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
You're keeping a record, are you?
I don't mind...
She's such a great photographer.
So how much do you hate her?
Not nice.  Not kind.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Look around, sweetheart.
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Worker!  Come back here now!
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Hlllllllp!
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Duty calls!
Oh, no, sir!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
So...you two are in love?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
...Ants...
I'll be back.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
I can't think of any.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
It's a bet.
Really?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Oh, I understand.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
Who?
In his apartment.
Baxter.
Give what up?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Gin.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
Oh.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I know so. He's a taker.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Oh.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't know.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Mine?
Very clever.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
What does he mean, accident?
You?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Let me get my bag.
Aren't you?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
You didn't really believe me, did you?
You're not being funny.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Fran --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Sssssh.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
It's a thought.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
One for all -- all for one --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
Let's talk about you.
Fat. That's real fat.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
I don't know.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
... he's an amazing officer.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Shot himself. What for ?
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Signs?
Which way? Right or left?
Looks pretty shallow.
Whose orders ?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Charlie?
A lame ?
Boss left.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
I met him.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
I love it.
I can handle it.
I think think a lie stinks.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
No -- leave it --
You're Australian?
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
Wait 'til I'm across!
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Wait a second.
I'll tell you everything later.
My home is here.  With you.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Not in the right hands it ain't.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
I'm a waitress.
Me. My home number is on this card.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Spencer.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How old are you?
How do you know about my mother?
Just how grateful I am.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
My son.
Are you still coming?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
Yeah... Well...
Cute.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
I should've danced with you.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
What a nice compliment.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
You changed the room around...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Thanks for looking after him.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Verdell?
Thank you for walking him.
Get out.
This stuff is pointless.
Another place where?
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
Right.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Bain!
I'm worried about you, Robert.
Where are we going?
Until a minute ago.
Another contractor.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
No.  Just Electra.
It's not the same, is it?
Why?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
I was just different.
No, they didn't.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Because you are a women.
They tried to kill you?
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
That's fiction.
You were there?
That sounds nice.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
In Costa Blanca.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Check.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I told you, he will.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes.  Here I am again.
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
Are you attracted to me?
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
No.
That doesn't sound normal.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Everyone regrets something.
Sometimes.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
It's a common question.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
An alternative literary venue!
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Care to elaborate?
And put it on expenses?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
We don't speak Czech!
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
What happened?
You're kidding.
Did you see anything in the files?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Siberia.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
I'm not hungry, really.
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah!
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You used to read.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
What?
You're everything a guy could want.
I hope so!
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Sure, they are students.
It's not so much.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Yo, dobree!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Am I invited?
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Sometimes.
Run into Josh?
It's Josh's.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
Just yesterday.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
We're not sure...
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Why not?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
No. I won't be long.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
I meant he's a doctor.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Were?
You don't know me.
I don't want to have any conversation.
So you agree you need help?
Don't bother!
You think so.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
In 76 years, me neither.
My relationship with God is my own.
Don't you?
Yes. And?
That would be the reason.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Why not?
It's only 7:30.
What are you talking about?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Not possible.
That. And less strange.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Hoped for it.
I'm sick.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
Better. I was really angry.
Ever again.
No.
So talk to us about something.
Either. Both.
How -- how long does she have?
I thought she built it herself.
I'm no dummy.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
Are you?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Oh yeah.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
And where am I gonna be?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What year?
Shhhhhhhh!
You know me?
Oh, yeah.
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
That's just great!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
The Orpheum.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
What's going on?
Yeah.
You expect me to believe that?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Sure.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Yeah.
What?
Well... I don't think that'd work.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
I got him in the stomach.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
No.
Yeah.
Really?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Sure.
Yes?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Vanished. Thin air.
First thing I did.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
No, I don't.
Oh, my.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Why me?
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Drown all those rascals...
So be it.
And what would that be, son?
Ever act?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
What do I write about?
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, I can tell you some stories –
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
That's all right, really –
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Are you sure –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
We gotta call the police –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Mr. Lipnik.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
Nine days – Tuesday –
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Physician, heal thyself.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
Yeah.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Were you with him last night?
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Why not?
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
Fine.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
About three months before I met you.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
No.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Somebody always does.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Sometimes.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
I said keep it.
It was an accident.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
Yes I did.
No. Should I have?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Let's get out of here.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
The whole thing – painting.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
Saddle River, New York!
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
You haven't been by lately.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Decipher?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
About what?
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
Come on in!
Guess I just got sick of him.
Party girls? Can I call you?
You mean babies with you?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Pretty much the same.
George?
What's his name?
You're a fast mover.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
So what?
I can't. After the show.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
That's ignorant.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Yes, I suppose that we did.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Had one.  Didn't work.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Right here, sir.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Coming on line now, sir.
You are going back to school.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
I wouldn't bet on that.
What?
I wish I knew.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
She wants to kill you.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
I think they're getting worse.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
What did you say?
Actually, he took the car.
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
...A bat.
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Wait. You can't go.
On occasion. Usually at night.
That's usually my line.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I don't-.
What are you talking about?
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
What say we flip for it?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
About what?
Miss.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
... A hundred and eight?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I loathe bats.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
What is it you want?
No one would miss me.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Holy shit...
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
He's not crazy.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Great. How??
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
David, I'm serious!
About Charles...
Annie, it's me.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
What?  What?
Ahm.... .
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
David?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Mmmmm...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Sure did.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Are you?
What?
Yeah, heh heh.
No it wasn't!
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Cool, huh huh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Uh... dill, um, face...
Yer late.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Who knows?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Yup. Huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
No, Jane.
Almost.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Won't?  Or can't?
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
He might have hurt somebody.
What makes you think she likes me?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
What?
We were trying to scare your mother.
You don't kill anyone.
Now, let's get rolling!
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Just one daughter.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
Step... mother.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Are you a spirit too?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
Your qu...?  But you're...
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
I think she's in with them.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Thank you, Robert.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Oh. I have a message for him.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Fine. He's very nice.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
That's very interesting, Eve.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
And I'm Ben.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Yes.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
So...? Where the hell is it?
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Yeah.
Malkovich!
Yeah. Okay.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
The iguana.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
Now?
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
Fuck Maxine.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
The monkey.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Yex?
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
I am a trained performer.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Who told you?
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
It better be.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Do you?
Says who?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
When?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Great then.
Is there dancing?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Sleepy suddenly.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
What want ye, girl child?
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
and she is mine...
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
May I come in?
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
Fine. But what would I do at night?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Could be that fall you took.
Won't you be late for work?
Go upstairs I said!!
Oh I been out.
Can't locate him.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Ella.
I run him off.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
It ain't what you think.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Who is she? Where she come from?
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
And this guy peed on it.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Huh?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Far out.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Dieter Hauff?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
I want you to see him immediately.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh...
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
No, but--
Am I wrong!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.
No, you're not wrong--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Huh?
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Huh?
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
This driveway.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Dude, I'm sorry--
Okay, listen--
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well we--I don't--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
This is a league game, Smokey!
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
Nothing.
Minutes.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Fry 'em.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Scud.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
Frost!!!
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
What do you see here?
Look closer.
Some kind of archive --
Blade --
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
What about the chemistry panel?
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Go on, I'll be fine!
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--a six week bun in the oven--
What is <u>this</u>?
I don't know. Nightmare.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I guess, yeah.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
Sometimes.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
What? That made her lose the baby?
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
How's she going to know where to--
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
The wheel.
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Still working on it.
That's the <u>reason</u>.
I know, I know--
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
--I know!
Heather.
--fuck Anna!
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
--the Sheriff's Office--
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No.
I am?
Meurice--
I just gotta see a guy.
I couldn't believe it either...
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
I said you're bad.
All right...
In the trunk.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
With your gun?...
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
What night is it?
Lubbock?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
What's the matter?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You owe me for two weeks.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
You're an idiot.
Red Label.
Pour that back.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Tuesday.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Why do you do it?
It's blue. blue velvet.
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
If you want to.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
No way.
Yes.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Don't say that.
O.K.
Yes.
I'm doing it.
Sometimes I think I do.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Why not?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Shoot.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Hey Jeff.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
You'll see for yourself.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
It's garbage.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Barbara and me.  No one else.
What kind of project?
Because I got caught.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
I love you too, man.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
You fucked me, Diego.
Today.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Money.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I know.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I'll tell her.
Figured what out?
She did that before.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
Yeah.
What's happening to us?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
I'll be here.
You swear?
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Because she's visiting me.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Yeah?
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
I understand. What's your question?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Good evening, sir.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Could you be more specific?
Your witness.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Why would she want that?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Yes -- several times.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
You called him?
Oriental medicine.
Yes -- quite easy.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Did he make your life miserable?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Three fifteen.
Then you would have gotten your money?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Yes -- she did.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
You take a lot for granted.
You can see me now.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
I'm always open to learning new things.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
What's she like?
I'll talk to him later.
Not even if they're a dork?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
It had to get there somehow.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
It's not that long.
I simply can not stand that tone!
No treasure maps, huh?
Michael.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Don't say that!
You're right -- that is sick.
Oh. When did you move back?
Yeah.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Clean?
I think so.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
I don't think you're normal.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
You drink bug repellent?
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Why do you say that?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Stop it!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
But now that you have it -
What about your husband?
Sure.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Nah.
Yes, they are.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Keep smokin', fool.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Damned if I know.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
That's some terrible shit.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I have to finish this for class.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Mother!  No.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Here!
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You were just a kid.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Post-toasted's more like it.
Here, put this in his mouth.
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
Just admit it, Caesar.
I think you're fucking crazy!
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
What are you talking about?
What are you, drunk?
No!  They're still on their way.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
This is insane!
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Yes, I understand.
It's all right, sir.
Five.
I should be going.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Me?  Why?
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Leave your phone on the hook.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Oh, I'm sorry --
I knew it.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
...  yes.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
I guess I wanted to.
Because it's the truth.
What was it then?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Yes.
Is that what you think?
Then what?  Exactly.
To let it dry.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
What happened?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
If he does ...
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
I know you will.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
What is Treadstone?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
Keep it. 
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Look, maybe I should just...
Yeah, I know...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
You are a friend of his?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Thanks.
Did you?
That'd be great.
For twenty thousand dollars.
You have blood on your pants.
I know that.
What does that mean?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- there's no time --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
Go back to the hotel.
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
Yes.
What?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
That'll solve all our problems.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
...sabotage!
You must save the day.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
No, no ... I did that...
SAM! What a surprise!
Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Ah ...
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Very smart.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Bastard!!!
No.
Why not?
Looking for you.
We've got both.
Well, terrorists of course.
What?
Turn!
What?
Go away.
Leave me alone!
Where are you going?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Don't worry.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
I delivered it.
A woman eh? I see.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Mother!
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
My I.D. cards.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
We'll be back.
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What?
Are you saying this is illegal?
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
You're going to live.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Ten-four.
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I think it looks good.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Okay.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
You married?
Five years.
Sure.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Maybe I should come up with you.
No, no.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Come on up.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
What do you think?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
I've taken that into consideration.
I never felt better in my life.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
What do you want to break?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
I'd give anything if that were true.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
No.
Then what was good about it?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
I'm not kidding.
This is important to me.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Thanks.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
It's started.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
No.  Not even you.
I don't know.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
That actually goes on...
I trust you.
One year...almost one year.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
Yeah.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
That's yes?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I didn't finish talking to you!
N-no...
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Here here...
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
Just about anything, Walter.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Hm.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Why not?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I know, man.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well I was uh, just looking...
A parakeet?
You want me to open a window or something?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
C-connection?
You are?
I ain't going no place with you!
Walter shut up and relax!
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Yes, get rid of them...
I can't.  I gotta go home.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
I was just straightening up the place.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
You didn't like them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Wheels?
Probably.  What movie is this?
You broke up with my machine?
No...
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
No, you're not.
Mmkay.
Thanks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
I forgot.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Am I in trouble or something?
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
Lothos.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Sporting events, yeah.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
Watchers?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
Jeffrey!
Okay.
You're kidding.
What is she...
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Except for Prom.
You said "Crash".
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Which nostril am I breathing through?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
G'night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Beg me again!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
How?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Naw...
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
C ' mon!
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Take the first shot at me.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Jim looking for somebody.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I can't do that.
Oh, good.
All right, take care.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
I'll call you right back.
Right back.
Ohhh...
You mean, I have your permission?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Listen...
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah?
I lost control?
Listen, I would -
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
You never - ?
Sammy.
It's me.
Nick?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Seven o'clock?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
I...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
Okay. 
Hey, Mitch.
I - I - I...
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
It's nice isn't it?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What are you talkin' a- ?
You can trust me.
What?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
All right...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wouldn't do that...
I am not!
Not gonna let me in?
I am calm!
...and hypocrisy.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
So, you're a righty?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I didn't give 'em the m-
You gotta go back out there.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
He won't...
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Here we go!
Is that the last one?
Yeah. Fuck him.
He's not here?
Calm down! Calm down!
We can't help him if -
I know.
And I mean... that's no good.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Are you sure?
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Okay, Sammy.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Yes.
Come on! 
You do?
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Okay, then.
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Yeah.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Stacy. 
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Hey.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Having a good time?
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Guilty. I am.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
What did you think?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
She has a real spirit.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
What do you want from me?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I got her...
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Actually, yes.
Hey, I thought...
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
You going to talk all day?
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Or relieve me of it later.
Not this minute.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
What do you keep making me out to be?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
The one in Brentwood.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Are you okay?
I can't do it.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
What's Nels' number?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Only one way to find out.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Twenty percent.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Pass.
Got a phone in that van?
I wish it had never been invented.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
It's your call.
You'll see her.
It's in the process.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
And not a nickel.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
The fuck I will!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
In your dreams.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
How?
Persistent.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Bloody right I do...
Guy I work with.
No.
Jimmy?
Perform?
You can't leave me then, can you?
Must be.
What'll it be?
Shouldn't I go?
Maybe.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Aha.
Depends what it is.
All the time.
Dil --
Must be.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Shut up.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Okay.
She from Scotland too?
More than that.
For me.
My pills...
Died...
No.
I suppose I tried.
Tell me you love me.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Carnations.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
You're never out, Fergus.
And what happens then?
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
I take pride in my work.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
It's your decision.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
You sure about that?
Who'd you think it was?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good.
Hope not.
So it's on the street.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What do you know about my nature?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She your wife?
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
The fastest.
How different?
My pleasure, Jody
Give us a break.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
I don't know her.
A story.
Yeah?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Relax -- you're gaining.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
I heard you, I heard you.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Thanks very much.
But --
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
It's all right with us --
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
Scobie?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
What are you doing?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Hm?
Yes, I know.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
The money is unimportant.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Stop it!
Leave?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
And this?
Quitter.
Now you're angry.
Instant divorce you mean?
I'm still having trouble with English.
The man and the woman are married --
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Who said?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
What?
That's all.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
I don't understa--
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
But what?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
He's allergic to him.
We will separate -- you look over there.
He took care of Charlie for us.
We want that money -- now!
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
It won't happen again.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Are you sure?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Ok.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Yes!
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Don't make me order you.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
No, you keep one.
No.
Told you to hide it.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Yes. Unfair to me.

I'm gonna stomp your a--

What the hell's goin' on?
Yeah, borrowed!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Ah, one of them's in the back.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!

I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!

 No...

Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Whoo!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Oh, shit!

We got two paddles.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Hey.   Mason.
...deal with this asshole.
No. 


 Come on!
 Okay.
Arlo!
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
We've got Elvis!
It's melting, man.

We got-...
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

Go.
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Hello.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
I think so too.
Thank you.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Yeah.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
We're worried...
And it won't be pleasant. 

You look fit...healthy...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Went away?

Heat's murder.
'Course you do, Jake.
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
That's too bad.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
When was the last time?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
She's fine.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
What are you talking about?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
Jake, listen.
Yeah, they are.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
And why's that?
Too late for what?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Of course.
Yes.
A private investigator?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Iced tea.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
I have?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Oh.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
And I want to know where.
Yes.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
What did you do that for?
To Mexico...
...so that's why you hate him...
I'm all right.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
The obituary column?
Okay.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I never was.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yes...
Well, no.
Si.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
So how are you, Morty?
I'm afraid so.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah, I'll do that.
He's not in, Mr.?
Yes.
Yes.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Fifty lire... 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Why? What do you mean?
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Yes. 
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Then where's the money?
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
OK...
What does it say there?
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
That's a long story.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Certainly not.
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
No.  But you're close.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I work at Seligman's.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
I mean in New York.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not sorry.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Where'm I going?
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
It's been a tough day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I've got to think of Emily -
What do you mean by that?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Hey, Nurse!
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
I know, but -
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Rosebud?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
No, this is great.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I'll try to manage.
And you said yes?
How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No, you're not really getting married?
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I'm giving him his ring back.
What?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
So what are you saying?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
We did.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Peptic ulcer.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Eight and a half.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
What about Veronica?
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
More or less.
So they build another Death Star, right?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Perfect dozen.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
The milkmaids.
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you believe this?!
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Gatorade.
What!?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I like to expand my horizons.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
I'm not. She just left.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Jesus.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
I know I can bench more than that!
Jesus Christ, what next?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I... I don't believe this...
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Typically male point of view.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
You've only had sex with three different people?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
He gets off on it.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
I'm going to class.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
What did he say?
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
What time do you get finished?
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
I don't want to go back with her...
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
He's your cousin?
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
You hope what feels good?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Says who?
Bye  That was Snowball.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I copy.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
I love you, too.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Three...
Nice and easy...
Patience my love, patience.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Hal knows what he's doing.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
Where's Hal, what's going on?
You know me, I'm a night person.
What about you?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
Helluva time for vanity!
Don't let me fall!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Take the rope.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
Half a day.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Let's move your ass in there!!
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Appreciate it.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Try the wine!
You've not been to school all week, son.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Surprise?
Keeping fit then?
Oh, aye, aye.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
I'm gonna be sick.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
C of E, sir.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
But it was horrible.
Yes!!!
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
I was quite enjoying that.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Max, the cab driver!
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
The crowd had to dig it.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Sorry?
Can you finish on schedule?
Twenty five?
I never bought that.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Not our call, Phil.
This isn't our goddamn game!
It's nothing.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What's he sayin'?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Believe it.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
You go every night?
Jazz.
It's not bullshit.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
Dmitri?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Head towards Union Station.
And you believe me...?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
None of your business.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Shut the hell up.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
No.
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Can you prove any of this?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Did you kill him?
He gave it to me.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Back where?
Because he believed me.
Don't do this.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
I'm leaning toward no.
Whatever.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Excuse me?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Your call.  Have a good night.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
I don't think so.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Tell me.
I disagree.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
Thank you?
And?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
This is how you see the sky?
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Because I can't.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Now... you go home.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
A page-break signal.  A period.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
The systems integration site.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Sounds like a Russian general.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Any luck on the grant money?
Greenbank?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Ellie --
Like it.  Almost there.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
And where exactly does that put your position...?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Now you know.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
You're willing to die for this.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
The final countdown.
Thank you.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Cut that backsass!
I'll make it a dollar.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes, Boss.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Tramp! Beautiful!
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
So then you just call him.
I call.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Cool Hand Luke.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You phony creep!
About what?
Hal has it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Where are you, Peter?
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I think you will.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
You're calling me a crank?
If he's not out, why are they here?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
<u>He</u> won't.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Well, thanks.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Michael Johnson.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Just horseshit luck.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
It is?
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
No. But when he's in that car...
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Yeah, and a dimple.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
But everything's OK?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Come on.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
Ruth's already taken him home.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
A deal's a deal.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
Who do you think you are?
It's magic.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I better make a list.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Open up.    I want to see.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You got wine. That's great.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Letty, please.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
She's only known the guy a few months.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
That's a big question.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It doesn't matter who.
He's a patient here.
Here's the ring.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Marcel?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
What?
I'm not here to negotiate.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Good word.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
Where are you staying?
Thank you.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
What'd you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Does it really matter what I say?
What do you want now?
Why haven't you turned us in?
-- Did you set it up?
What?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Everything.
Everything?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Good song though.
Great fuckin' song.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
You lived there. You know the city.
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You see that car?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
Glenmorangie is very good.
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
I don't know.
Tonight.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I'm just playing around.
Let's go!
Long.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
You're probably right.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Give me back my comb.
Give it back.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Fine.
I left the training early.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
What have you discovered?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
I'll look around and catch up later.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Annie, I need a file.
Thanks, babe.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
In a better place.  I hope.
I went to see a friend of mine.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Take the dope, too.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Very well, it's your ass.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I know.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Because you act like a pig.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Somerset Maugham.
What?
I can't win with you.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Because I'm in love with you.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Get off me.
It was perfect.
Sure.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Is it that obvious?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
No.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Blow me.
Yeah.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
So? How'd it go last night?
Mock, mock, mock.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Not at all. What's wrong?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
She's not here.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Did your wishes ever come true?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
I think I should.  3000W?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Amy's been lying again.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Yes, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But...
Yes, darling.
But where do you come from?
Will you be friend for always?
But you must!
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That one's an elm.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Soon as I finish.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But I only came to give back the ring.
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
No, thank you.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Mommy read it to ne.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Yes...yes, that's true.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
I've been working out.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
At least your PMS is over.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
It is so hot in here.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
What choice do we have?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
You don't have to pee.
So pee? Here?
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Script coverage?
Your desk.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Oh, it's nothing.
What are they for?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
We didn't have sex.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
The other one?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
Where does it lead?
Maybe.
Why?
That's easy.  You...
Right.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
TilT we figure something out.
Soon.
What about containment, Alan?
What about her.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
It's a homeless shelter.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Three years.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
He was only doing his job.
Are you threatening me?
Jesus...
That'd be great.
Well -- take care.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
What?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
This is wrong, Alan!
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Does it make the cars any better?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
No.
We'd like to hire you.
You got a gun?
But it's ten-thirty at night.
The Vice-President...
You don't change, do you, Bill?
No.
You weren't in the state legislature.
I don't know.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Truman used it all the time.
I don't mind.
Oh... Okay.
Yes.
It's nice.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Ain't no place safe.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
It's because of me.
Let me see your weapon.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox?
Yeah.
Well?
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
what?!
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Okay.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Isn't there an easier way?
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Good luck.
But father, it's not fair.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
What is it?
My brother went here.
I... I just don't want to come.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
What is that supposed to mean?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Neil, you're not gonna...
what?
This play?
No thanks.
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Which question is that?
How soon can we get up and running?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
You people...rich people...
That's what I do.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Self sufficient...
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
I'm stuck...
That way.
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Well... you remember Cynthia?
You don't!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Married?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Oh. Fine.
Naw.
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Kind of. You didn't know?
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman!
I don't know! I don't know either!
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Frost.
I see you're going hunting.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
Who the hell knows!
There's Vince!
Yeah... I guess.
Oh.
Hell no!
From Nam?
What do you think?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No way. No fucking way!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
That's it. No. No way.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Naw.  Uh-huh.
No.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
What'cha got, Bennett?
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Fuck you - fuck you.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
When you bring in Doucet.
Not anymore.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Telephone repairman.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Not the 'T' word.
Ooops, I forgot.
I'm ready.
Yes.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Good night, Wade.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Good to know you, Willy.
Hi.
This little thing says I can't.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
But I like the new one better.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Some other time, Stevens.
You are afraid!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Opportunities?
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
Look here now--
He was --
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Headache -- Squire?
Camomile tea!
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Yep.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
I dunno.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Me -- a son.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Cup for cup!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Don't call yourself fat.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Yeah.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
That's good then.  You've found something.
Do you still want the operation?
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Who's this?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
They're okay.
How many you got in there?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
What else?
We're bringing in your wife...
I want to talk to him.
Give me the keys...
I don't fool around with you.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
They look like good kids.
What about Howard?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
What?
... The bodies out the door.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
We won't have to.
All right ... send them the guard.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Bullshit!
I want to talk to Leon.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
No!
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
No. Please enlighten me.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Something is going down. Something bad.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Real fast.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
My brother.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
So?
So, in other words, you are not down.
You a troublemaker?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
OK.  OK.
What makes Sammy run?
See ya around.
He's just being nice.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
How are you holding up in this weather?
What is?
Can ya dig it?
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
I got no say over people.
Can't do.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Here, you gotta delivery.
Keep it.
C'mere, Doctor.
What else?
Trust me.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Eddie Murphy.
Yeah.
That's what I think.
We're outta here.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
On the rebound.
Sez me.
I love you.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
I'll tell you why!
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
I'm fine.
I don't follow.
Home school? What's that?
Me too!
What?
Will not.
You take that back!
Kids.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
They can't be real.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Some what?
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
I bet you want your head scratched.
A blimp.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
No. Look.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
But my mom gave me the map.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Right.
That's gross.
No.
Oh I think you do.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Thanks, Pop.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
What the hell are you talking about?
And I you.
Everything. Just for the record.
Just like the President.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Yes...
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Ha!
Really?
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Don't you bave a car?
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
Eddie, you screwed up.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
I guessed.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
This is my way of telling you --
Oh, just like in the script!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But there's plenty of other parts.
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
That's right...
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
That's not true --
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
You could say that --
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Yes?
I think you're quite handsome.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Tits.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
Maybe it needs special handling.
"Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
How long's he been here?
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
I do.
Who?
What if--you're vomiting?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Come on...
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Who?
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
So?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Good luck.

Who?
You said that.
What?
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Oh my God!!
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Mom?
All right. Let them decide.
Our foibles, our foibles!
No, I mean...
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Cream rinse?
Leave. Go.
I missed you.
No. Who?
...yeah?
No. It's your fault.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Why do you do that?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Yeah.
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
You brought the girl!
Please!
Ray, come an--
No problema.  You want a picture?
No. Two times.
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
Yeah. Why?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
Dick.
So nice
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Yeah?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Plenty of pep, too.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And when did you do it?
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Yep.
We'll let it run awhile
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
What work?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Dudley.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
That's right.
What little studio?
I got her address.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
What does that have to do --
And?
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
No.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
Give me a minute, will ya?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
How about White?
You, me and White, huh?
Where is he?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
None.  Call it a hunch.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
You tight with the D.A., trash?
And Reynolds?
Around.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
You're not.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
The NSA?
You're crazy.
It's a SAT-tracker.
We said a hundred.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Look, my wife is understandably--
I didn't use my name.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Jesus.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Listen--
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Shit.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
You got any money?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<u>What's</u> your point.
About what?
What kind of trouble.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I saw a man die.
I'm sorry.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
It's not true.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Oh, please--
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Good.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
The lingerie.
What is it?
It's a brand new card.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
Other than Brill.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
Thank you.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Mr. Dean--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Where's Stacy?
She can't talk to you right now.
Can I open 'em up?
You staying for dinner?
Where've you been?
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
Serve the ball.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
I don't know!
Listen to me.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I need help.
Tell me about it.
Are you still in Crystal City?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
I don't know.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Sir--
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
We don't know.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Excuse me?
You sing.  All the time.
I do not.
Shall we be all right?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
It's a folk song.
Don't do this.
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I know.
Still a car.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
What's the matter with you?
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I think that's called looting.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Very true!
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
We shall miss you.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
He's Canadian.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
I love you.

I've met you before.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
No. But he hands them over.
Yes.  Later.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I mean home.  India.
Hello miss.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
A toddler
Only we have to go to work.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Excuse me?
So alive.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
True enough.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
To our...partnership.
Aren't we all.
What?
A billion dollars.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
And the money goes--
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
I'm sorry.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
They drive so recklessly there.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
No, you can't.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Call it an expression of trust.
Yeah. Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
It's those files you asked for.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
They did?
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
And get someone to help around the house.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Where's Anna?
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Bullshit.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Whoa.  No shit.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
What do you mean?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Ross.
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
You're married.
I'm gonna hate it.
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Nothing.
Keep your voice down.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
Thinking.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Uh-huh?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
What's wrong with him?
Barks his Òright on!Ó
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
You know the Jedi Master?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
It can wait.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Now you're making sense.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
That's quite a compliment.
Why?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Are you kidding?
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
You may call me Leia.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Let's go.
What did you say?!
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No!
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
They're...pretending to dress.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
They look pretty docile.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
I like you.
Give it.
I thought he was, but he came back.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Not anymore.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
If he lets you get close enough.
Looking to get out.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
What the hell is this?
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Give me the prototype.
Who ain't?
I cannot--
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
That's not why you came.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
In the great book.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Not you, my husband?
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
To kill and be king, is that all?
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Thank you your excellency.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
No kidding.
What is it?
Sure you won't change your mind?
Groceries maybe? A package?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
That depends.
You wouldn't.
I didn't get you?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
No, is Regan aware of it?
Please.
It's fine really, sit.
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
No.
You like it?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Oh I bet he is.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Sure.
No.
You and us.
Uh Huh.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I've seen him.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Yeah, a fall.
It's possible. Possible however…
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
Yeah, come on in.
Swimming trunks.
What's wrong with them?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You're their uncle.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
No, I mean it.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
I don't know what you mean.
What was it like?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
Let's get it over with.
I didn't get her number.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Yeah.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
Time flies, huh?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
February?
You could've come.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Just until we find another girl.
I don't know.
What're you doing?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I'll take the Mallory.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
Don't take it personally.
Hey!
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Hey.
Great.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Will I see you again?
Thanks.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Save it.  What's he look like?
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
The Stratford.
Huh?
How's egghead?
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Soap?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You sending me home?
Coffee?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
So how's the cat food business?
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Another five years, huh?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Looks old.
Oh, fine.
Eddie.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
It's important.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
What do you mean?
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Not if I kill you first ...
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
I mean like protection.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
You always say that -- then you leave.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Adelle?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Mom liked it.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Pretty much.
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
What?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Get out!
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
I’m working on a new deal now...
Whatever you say...honey.
It’s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I’m gonna buy it...
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
It’s good, right?
Zeena...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
Now...I don’t...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I’m sorry, no...
Last night was great...
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Relax, it's casual.
You'd never know it.
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
Youthful high spirits.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
About me?  How sweet.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
I can go hotter!
Johnny.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Hilarious.
Which was?
We need to get past them.
If it happened to him, then it could...
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
A surgeon might...
You left something out.
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Looks simple to operate.
I'll do what I can.
Certainly.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
What the heck d'ya mean?
That's right. And we need more money.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
Oh sure.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Uh-huh... A what?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
No. No, ma'am.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, okay.
Yah.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Well, they -
The heck d'ya mean?
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
Oh, yah?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Aw, Norm.
No, that's okay.
I see that! That's great!
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
It's okay...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
There's the car! There's the car!
Prowler needs a jump.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
What does that mean?
I'll ask the questions, son.
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
You haven't been going to yours.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
What the hell are you doing here?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Feel anything?
Nothing.
Uh ... nah.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Is this a trick?
Is that what you're calling it?
Say my name.
Marla, no, wait...
My suitcase was vibrating?
I mean -- for a living.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
A hotel?
Yeah.
No, I...
What?
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
The fight.
What fight?
This fight, pussy.
Anyone?
My dad.  No question.
I know that.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
No.  Not at all.
Promise?
No, I'm not...
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
What... what are you saying?
You took me to the house.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
This is not about martyrdom.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
You need me.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Appreciate something.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Really?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Pleeeeeease!
Yesssss...
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
I...I...
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Clean up?  I don't...
Who is this guy, anyway?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I...I don't know.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
Nice try, kiddo.
Thirty-nine.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
You're the fuckin' devil.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
No.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Pirates?  No kidding?
You never been in one of those things.
I suppose you have...
You comin'?
Duck soup.
I thought he was with you.
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
What?
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Colonel.
Do I look like I have someone special?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
You're all right... you sure...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
The moron?
He's not a moron.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
No...  He is supposed to live there?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
It was a crime.
You can ask.
Fine.  I'll say no.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
My name is Parry.
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Parry... I'm Jack.
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Who are you talking to Jack?
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
I don't like horror movies!
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
There isn't any more to tell.
Don't say that.
What are we about to do?
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Serveza yourself!
Yes.
I'm not some piece a crap.
You'll be gone, period.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Okay...
What?
No.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
How do you know it's clean?
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Who's Van Oost?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
With applesauce?
Yeah, well, he's...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I don't know where she is!
You were going without saying goodbye?
But what about me?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Something witty and devastating like that.
Of course I'd like to.
I have to talk to you.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
At game, Carl.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Perhaps...
Yes.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
What?
Hi.
Nothin'.
You got a boyfriend?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I buy them flowers.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
No, Baruch.
You said before, that he got boxes?
You here to see somebody?
Who?
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Would you like me to change anything?
They didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Fletch F. Fletch
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Yes.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
No idea.
Like when?
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don’t you?
Affirmative.
You don't have a piece of the action?
Thank you.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
He'll be so relieved.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
No problem.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Sure you did.
Who?
I have the same problem with my help.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Take it where?
You sure those doors will be open?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John Ultrarelamensky.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What are you talking about?
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
I recommend it.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
What?
She moved out.
Tell the cops.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
How gray?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Utah?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
I was upset.
Who's Frieda?
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
I'll do my best.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Contacts.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
Johnny's C.D.?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
'Booty Time.'
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Go on, another time, another place.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Yes --
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's your problem.
It's yours too!
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Pour it in your ear.
Pass.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
What is that old building?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
What are you saying?
Nothing.
You're shitting me!
I seem nervous, huh?
Sure.
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
Luck, my ass.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Wait...
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
I lost you.
On the job?
Yeah, it's me.
I'm glad.
I'll warn them.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
How?
H-hi.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
What?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Dad, you there?
Sully!  Is that you?
Better.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Look who's talking.
Yeah, that's right.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Same thing.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Where's Shelly?
I'll think of something.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
A hammock?
Is that so bad?
What?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
I never said you were "nothing".
Who's Horace?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Lake Forest Green?
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
Nancy.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I've seen it.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
Tell me.
Sorry.
That's all right.  I was just...
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Oh my God, Steven.
Randy, c'mon!
Don't do anything stupid.
Okay.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
You don't know shit!
I'm literally going to kill you!
But she might be in trouble...
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Hear what?
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're telling a lie.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
It's not that simple.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
What do you mean???
Is the ship going to sink??
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Big mess every time.
She wants a divorce.
We must abandon.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll hate it.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
The Red Sox
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
What else?
A flat-out hit.
What do we want?
What's sexy?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Yes.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Joanne Bourne.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
What did it say?
Pop, will you let me in?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Show him who we are.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
It's the kid's lucky day.
You're charming the boy.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yes.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Say it again.
Would you like to meet him?
The fact is, I have to get going.
Where are you going now?
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
I haven't come to you.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I am your wife.
Eleven.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
The fools!  Sorry...
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
It's for the best.
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
No?  What's keeping you?
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Grudges?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Blood.  From the vein.
Something's not right.
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Again?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
What's wrong with him?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Where?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
If you say so.  The stripe.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
New policy.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I get my own help.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Assumed name... Houston.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Better than I remembered.
Yeah... I know.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do it my way.
I'll bet you can.
What do you want to do?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Like what?
I didn't mean police.
El Paso.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I guess you're right.
Whatever happens it's over.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Chicago.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
You serious?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
And you told Brumby?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Well, he drove it into the river.
Was he?
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Address?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Why'd you see him so regular?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
I work for him.
No, do you really?
Yes, while he was here.
Sure I'm sure.
Tell me about the girl.
And you didn't know her last name?
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
Nice of you to come.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Where would I find him?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
They came back?
No.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Jack Carter.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Still got your sense of humour.
Scotch, please.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
What for? Protective purposes?
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Ha.
They came in and they, you know...
No.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
With River Oaks?
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
What?
They have...
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Somebody...
As a "robbery"?!  No.
No.  Not actually.
We are?
For five thousand?
You.
That's none of your fucking business...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
How ya doing?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
The cops?
Where was I?
Did they catch...?
In school.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
...did they...
Are you talking to me?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You have a problem?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Under him?
Not lately it isn't.
...after the thirtieth...
...you talk to Murray...
Either way.  You're out.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Not lately you can't...
Twenty percent.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Because I say so.
Somebody broke in.
I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
What are you talking about?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Mmm.
Because I don't like you.
And did they steal the contracts...?
...yes...
He's right, Williamson.
Home...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Go ahead.
Me.
Mm.
I don't know.
Yes.
Mmmm...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
Tell me again.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
She wants her money back.
No.  She told me "right now."
What does that mean?
What power?
This.
What, "this"?
You going to turn State's?
You did that?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They--excuse me...
It went down.  I filed it.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Three.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
John...
On your pillow.
What if we don't pay?
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
He's the head of the family.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
 You're a good fellow.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What is it?  Can I help?
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
That's not the way we look at it.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I don't know.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Connie's outside.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Twenty-five this time.
No questions.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
I don't think that's necessary.
The witness is excused; take him out.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
His brother came to help him.
On a plane back to Sicily.
You would have killed his brother?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Says who?
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Good.
I thought we would meet alone.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
The same assurance we got from you.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
He supports me.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Fuck you.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
What's to be jealous of?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
A homo?
Well...no, not really --
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
But I didn't do this!
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
What way might that be?
But we have to match the other sketch.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Why not?
Very well put.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You were a soldier?
Clayton is fine.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
No.  The girl.
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
The Great War?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I didn't have the guts for it.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
What'd you say?
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Fuck off!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Don't go away.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I knew you'd say that.
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
A little family emergency --
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
What are you still doing here, Randall?
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Your girl works in there ...
The other day....
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Donny-nothin'!
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
You getting my checks ... ?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
What time of year?
You guys are through...
Sure -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Yeah -
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Come here -
I know ...
Where'd you find this one?
Call 'em here -- ?
And here I am...
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
Deodorant.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I think so... They're just... So ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
No worries ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
And Tracy's on the move ...
You remember Junie?
Is he still working here ?
No we don't -
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
She soars -
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
No more shines, Billy.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Anybody!  You understand?
I understand.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What are you gonna do?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Jimmy.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Yeah.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
We'll pick it up.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Yeah.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
No one. I didn't have the number.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
I told you "no" yesterday!
I don't have a VCR at my house.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
What is it?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
It's an integer proof.
--That edge!
It's right.  Take it home with you.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Find out what?
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Since Nancy died.
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
What don't I understand?
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Hold on!
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--I'm not angry at you--
Why there?
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
About thirty million to one.
There is somebody...
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
You're getting defensive, Will.
How about the ones on that shelf?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
So Christ, call her up.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I know.
Good luck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Not a chance.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Want me to take a look?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I guess so.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
So, do you play the piano?
No.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
You're *ticklin' me!*
People done it. If they could, we could.
Kids?
Can all of you work?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
Why ain't they more like it?
That cut you got?
Crate fell on me.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
Just around that next bend.
I aim to.
But we can still do it, honey.
Want to work, do you?
What's the matter? What's happened?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Oh!
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
That's where I get off.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
Take her with you!
California.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Stand by the door.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
When?
What's that--detour?
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Won't they ketch us?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
Never better.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Yes.
What's your business?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Yep.
Watched television?
I'll think about it.
Yes.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like love?
You're a government spook?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Hard to get good help these days.
Nope.
--Nooo--
I love. I kill.
This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And they want me to make up for it.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
No.
Thank you.
As long as you had a good time.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
That's good.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Five years. My son was born here.
How did you meet her?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Huh?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Thanks, honey.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I said... I started.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Yes. We're suing.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Yeah. Bye.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Why did you go?
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Tubab means white man.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
No. He had the choice.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
You too, Diane.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
You!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Mmm. An editor.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
That must have been pretty special.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
What does that mean?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
I know. Amazing.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
You shut up, stupid!
Oh yeah...
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Honey... I was always good.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Alright sir.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Mm-hmm.
And unpack.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
That's bullshit.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Think you can do better?
Yeah?
And if I win?
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Dreams?
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Virus?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
So?
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
This morning.
Don't get angry.
Look.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Has he been prepped?
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
No way. No how.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a real sister?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Yeah.
No.
Do you?
Got it Ben.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Its true, Sheriff.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Annie!
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Lee Brackett.
It's important.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You all right?
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I don't think so...
Sure. Sure.
See you.
I don't like that story.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...
There was no one outside.
I saw him...
What is it, Laurie?
Was it the bogyman?
Of course not.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Mm-mm!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Really?!
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yeah?
Well, are...are they big?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, great.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
How about you?
Yes?
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
I almost didn't.
Oh, my God.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
No!
Are you?
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
Always.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Absolutely.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mmm...
Why?
I'm saying it now!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
But not you.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
I bumped into your...
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
How are you?
Oh...
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Well, then a third opinion.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Now, Holly's not shy.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Really?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Good.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Oh, so loosely.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
...in a really horrible way.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Well...
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh!
It's all right.
Just a few minutes ago.
Where are the antihistamines?
Dad!
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
It's a growth business.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Say it in English.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How crazy is that.
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
....what...? 
I am all attention.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
...should love to correct your error. 
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Enchante.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
She my foster.
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
No, I don't get you...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Or clear your windshield with it.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
...I feel that...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
When?
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
You guys have been so colossal...

Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
That wants to be a Yes.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Nothing.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yes you do.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Probably.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
"Wichita"--The guy every boy wants                          ] to be and every girl wants to hold.                         ] You're the love of my life and the                          ] end of the world. Cheers.                                   ]
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Hey, don't run away now.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Like last night, Veronica?
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
You're not funny. Ouch!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Oh.
Did to.
No-o!
I thought I...you..
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>.
Get a job.
What's that?
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
Look who I've found!
Is it hurting, dear?
sighs.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
is very angry.
gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Somebody's got to help us!
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
All finished.
Second most common?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Since what?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What's the occasion?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Uh... eighty two?
Eighty four.
In a word? Lucrative.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
I don't work here.
Two.
Can you follow them?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
How recently?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You mean John Bubber?
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
She's talking to him now.
Helluva story!
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
Dad!
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
How are they with kids?
And the rent is okay?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
I should.
Right.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Do you do washing machines, too?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It is tomorrow.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
Stop knowing me so well.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
This is my house.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
No.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
It's a double.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Caution shows wisdom.
For what?
I'm sure they will.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Your life.
How?
Do you love me, Conner?
What are you hoping to find inside?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
You got me.
If it's good advice.
I don't know anymore.
Jennifer.
I'm interested in mythology.
Why?
Why?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
You?
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
It will end tonight.
Conner?
Sounds very -- normal.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
I like my work.
What will you do?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Keep trying.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Like what?
I'll give you these people.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
We don't have time!
Okey-doke.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Mine, too.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Go, Mickey.
They've been in there all day.
Where are you right now?
In my room.
Who is it?
They're still in the house.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
I guess we do.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
A delegation.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Six.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Today.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
You will tell them the truth.
Very good.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
You’re drunk.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
For supplies, you drive.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Why sir?
The commander is not here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Let's have dinner first.
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Dawn. Then they go.
Stay with the children.
What!
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Give him time.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
You cannot go alone.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Thank you, sir.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Thank you, Roger.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
Over here!
Take the gun.
Why not?
And then where are we?
Let's try down here...
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
He's gotta still be down here.
It's succeeding!
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
You know everything you do gets me hot.
Where is she?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
No, no, it's just --
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
It works.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
Blackburn's dead.
Something....happened --
What will they tell you?
Well I bet you they're happy.
I'm scared!
I'm ok mommy.
I want this one, daddy.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
You didn't think much about that before.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I'm all right...
Before.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Oh, that's nice...
Did you know her very well?
Thank you.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
What are you getting at!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
It will not take long...
Yes, they are.
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Runic?
Well what is it!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
What happened to him?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
A prize?  For what?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Yes. 53
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
But I said I was sorry....
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
I'm going to find out.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
I got my planet back.
Baseball, why?
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
Yes.
If you think you're getting past me...
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Just shut up and hit me!
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
The Dancing Dingus!
Snappy.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Adenoids?
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Now, Aim --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Ya know, entry level!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck they doin'?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
...It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Say, that was a swell idea!
But Buzz --
You --
Get your feet off that desk.
But, sir!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Fah from it...
He don't look wise.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Where?
At the Houmfort.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Yes.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Got a meeting uptown.
Yeah, good.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Rough day. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
See for yourself.
Don't be dim.
I'm not surprised.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well?
The phone's out.
I'm fine dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Yeah. You?
We were just riding around.
Oh Wendy.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
Of course.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
That's right.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Major.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Just be careful.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Play with the whip.
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
How do you know this shit?
Then why'd you come after me?
Huh?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
What's the D.A. got them on?
I had him!
Too bad...
Actually...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
We already did.
Do it again.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
No.
What happened at that signing?
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
That's right.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
No way.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Habit.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Since grade school.
That's what I said.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes down at the station.
I was a mentor to her.
No.
Then blame the one who made her...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
It will grow back again!
What plans?
He jests.
Why not?
I took your life. He gave you another one.
He'll never let us go.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Never.
That's not so.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I want a woman.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
How could I not? She had to know.
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
No.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Okay, I won't.
Just kidding.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
Ray, we're just friend.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
You sure?
You don't seem fine.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Did you get help?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Hey --
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How's Julie?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
How's the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
She's in her room.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
No.  She shall not be left here.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
But one must love a father.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
She's not too well.
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
We have no time for that.
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
When you make sense I'll listen.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Merry Christmas.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Suicide.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Not a soul.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Uh-huh.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Hee-haw!
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And all's fair in love and war?
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
What's that?
Huh?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
How do you do.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Uh-huh.
Come on, tell me.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
I'm going to scream!
How's that?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Do you like it?
Please, let's not stop, George.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Where's your coat and hat?
Oh, George, George!
You forgot something.
What?
Good.  It's terrible.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
The rope!  The rope!
No place special.  Just hanging out.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You want to come here a minute?
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
And sound.
Fooling around?
So's a donut.
One what?  Ah-ha!
For me?
Nothing, huh?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
That you were fired.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Someone has to do something.
What?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Sure they did....
Maybe.
That's a crock of shit.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Huh?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
I'm going.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
When are we going out?  You and me?
No.
So?  So?
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Pre-opening jitters.
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
And what else is bothering you?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Up.
And leave me down here???
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Bracelets.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
It's too soon to move him.
Come on.
Thirty feet???
I don't understand.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I thought they were clever.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
I like it when they wake up.
And I like you.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
... Massachussettans aren't.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Come on, it's fun!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
What?
That?
Hey.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
You have a man near it?
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
Where is she?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Henny Youngman....
I'd be afraid of losing....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Thanks for the consultation....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Good.
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
The plane's turning....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
Gave them the day off....
When I invited you...
Okay...we got it together....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
So did I....
Shit....
How come only me?
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Screw you, Jake....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
In a few minutes....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
How'd you do it, old man?
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Now?
I guess by the bed.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
And did they?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
He ain't offerin me shit.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
No.
Yes.
What color was it?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
What does that mean?
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
One of the accountants.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
Okay, this is working.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
No.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Oh tsht. Yes.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
It's all going to work.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Good idea.  Thank you.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Will you marry me?
Okay... I will...
At eleven at night? _ 70.
As opposed to twenty angry women?
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
But wait...
Jerry --
You said "fuck".
Yeah I know.  I did.
One way to find out.
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
He says it's a bad idea!
People change.
What?
When did you have it last?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Dr. Grant was.
Sure.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
But then you never get to go in space.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can’t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
You are an academic.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
My vacation is over in a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Oh, God.
No way.
No.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Why should they?
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
JUMP!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Uh - - about two million.
How am I supposed to transport them?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh!
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Why?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
What kind of park is it?
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I don't know.
Why not?
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Are they heavy?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Yes it is.
No.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
No.
The kids okay?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
You're sure?!
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Yes.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
We love the presents.
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
He... he's here...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
None of that's true?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Have you worked here long?
-- Small.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
What an extraordinary request!
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Yes.
You're just doing your job.
It's what I'm paid to do.
Well, I --
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
Why would you suppose so?
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
He was murdered.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Why were you given notice?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
Usually.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
I don't know.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
I could always apply there.
Oskar.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
I can't imagine you crying.
Two... maybe three.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
They' re dead.
Native costume?
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
What about him? Yes.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Guess!
Do you always have to repeat?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
No, that's not --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
My name's John Klute.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
What do you think?
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You said you wanted these.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Mm.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
We did this before.
Yup.
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
I don't think so.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I wanted to give it to you first.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
No.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Yeah.
In real life when does he hit you?
On earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
You are not allergic of onions.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Yep.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Sustained.
Overruled.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You want what?!
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Three months.  How can you tell?
Oh, no..
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I'm sure.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
What?
Yes, Holiness.
No!
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
What do you think?
I do not know, Holiness.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
You will always!
You cannot.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Yes.
We have.
You have grown up very good.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Why are we landing?
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
And you like me.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Hey!!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
The more he thrashes, the better.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
I never had sex with you!
<u>Hector</u>.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Oh, bullshit.
No.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
They could try to tranq him on land.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
It's too dangerous for--
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good luck.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Let's get away from the shore.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Thank you.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
Probably not.
Let's go.
They look like they're jumping.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
You too.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
What kind of backup do we have?
You have a thing against museums?
I got nothing against--
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
I just let go of it.
What is this?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Yes.
Look.
Look ten feet into the water.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Hot damn, Clarice.
Sometimes.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Good idea.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Murdered...? How?
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
By the book, he's a sadist.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
I - ran away...
Early. Still dark.
But you could. You did.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Absolutely.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Alice?
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Some say that's the way of it.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Then what?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Be my guest.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Can't we fix it?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I signed-up for the stock option.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Timex...
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Your pocket?
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
It's a Samoan pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
All right, furry muff.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Just carrying a bag.
No.
Out the back.
Hit the fuckers.
And look what happened to that.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
A hundred grand.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
You will what?
And?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
I can't help you, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
My van is half full.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Nick the Greek.
How many wings have they got between them?
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
So?
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I can't take any more school.
So?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Yes, sir.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
That badge--
You got a cause of death?
So is Buddy on your short list?
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
You look good--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
What?
Uncle Al--
He never asked her.
They fought against the Indians?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You wouldn't?
You own this place?
You lived in the States for a while?
Something like that.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Right.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Cliff--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Mikey--
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
Pleased to meet you.
That's where he fell.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Because I'm your father.
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
What about it?
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
What?
I only went for my last two years.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Yeah.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Couple months before I was born--
I appreciate you telling me.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
Yeah. It's quiet--
Sure.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Payne.
You believe that?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
They go together.
Who is he?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
How?
Why?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
That's so cool.
Deep shit?
Why did you wait so long?
And are you afraid?
Did your husband know Quaid?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
No.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Yes.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
You can't.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Fuck you.
Go away.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Shut up!
What's her problem?
Yes...
At birth.  I don't know you --
For what?
They'll never find out.
He deserved it.
Oh yeah?
I can't... I can't go any further...
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Yes! Yes!
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Why would I want to?
Yes.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?
How long have you been married?
I'm thinking about it.
No, how about you?
I know. I don't either.
Charlotte, who?
Do you want to have some breakfast?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
I know, I kind of blend in here.
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
You are.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Why can't it last?
Hi, Bob.
Well... have a good flight.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Uh, no.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Do you want to- 
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
I got some hair stuff.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I—.
Do you think they have a room here?
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Uh...sure...I...what?
I'm just temporarily off my game.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
We're still going to be together.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
I didn't know what else to do...
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
Yes, I know.
Then why are you here?
When's your birthday?
Comfort.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Parents died?
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Engaged.
Maybe she is.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
She's alright.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Uh-huh.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
What?
Why not?
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Mom's going to hate it.
And he's fine, girl.
Thanks.
Just like that?
You do act different.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Your legs don't look broke.
Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You either.
What?
Fine, Quincy.
Clothes.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Nah.  I have curfew.
Least she had time for me.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yup.
So...how's the knee?
Cause I don't get it.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
What's that, not great?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Didn't we already have this conversation?
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
And some things should never fucking happen!
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
After five years.
Look, I'm busy.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
What's wrong?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
It's a helluva disease.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Yeah.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
If you're not here for a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Well...is that illegal?
Bye.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You alone in there?
Claudia.
Claudia What?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- what kind?
Ready to go,go,go?
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
DAD.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Sorry, little man.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
Finish it up without the lip.
I was listening --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Who?
Alright.  Thank you.
Let's talk about --
Not really.
What am I doing?
Yeah.
the valley?
And what did your parents do?
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
When did he go off chemo?
...ok...
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I don't have to answer your questions.
No one else in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
What's this, how did this happen?
No.
No.
Yes.
Fuck no.
I need you to get me Paula --
You want her right now?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Love you too..
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
I think that you know.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
What would you like?
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
You coulda been in front --
I'm fine. nothing.
I didn't know the answer --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
God smiled upon us.
Nothing... Nothing.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is your brother!
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
How can I serve you in this?
I am with you!
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
But why?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Athos, my friend!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
She will be at the ball.
D'Artagnan...
A personal nature?
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
You may go, Lieutenant.
When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
My dear, I've already done it.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
And he took a swing at you?
Yeah?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Who is it?
You're the mysterious type, right?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Let's see what we got...
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Hop in.
Are you a regular there?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Nahhh...
That was Peterson upstairs.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
I'll pick you up in...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
It's not over yet.
Have him peel the top label back.
For Christ's sake get him!
Let's get to the physical.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
Yes, are you okay...?!
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
I don't understand.
Why do you think I called?
He's misunderstood.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
No.
I have to see somebody.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
What's the problem, Molly?
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Yeah...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Huh?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
You're insane.
Pictures?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Why does it feel good?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
Let's walk the route.
No.  Caspiar.
George, I hate sitcoms.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
I refuse.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
What is this, World War Two...?
It's working for Elvis.
I'll take my chances!!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Don't believe everything you hear.
I used to think you were original.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Bob Gorsky.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
You all look the same to me.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Hear what?
An accident?!
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
They'll be able to track it.
How?!
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
You've never used them before.
Your training.
Look again.
How does she know?
Why?
What do you believe in?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
How do you know that name?
Most guys do.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
But an Oracle can.
I'm going in after him.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Guns.  Lots of guns.
What the hell just happened?
You sure?
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther!  Same thing...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Wouldn't bother me.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
That's not going to help.
How?
Mind your own business.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Bye.
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It's still sick.
Sure...He lives there?
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
I know...I know.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
This is a heisted car!
Quiet please.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
It's for the party, Dad --
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
What will I tell Annie?
And that?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What 'business'?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Thank you.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
You have a way with words.
Olympic.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Certainly, Bill.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
You get not to go to jail.
That's what he said.
Doctor lady make it irey.
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Sure.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Oh yes, I do.
But she loves you?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes?
Whatever you do.
Be sorry for nothing.
I appreciate you --
And I appreciate you, too.
I don't know.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Don't.  That will come later.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
No.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
That's what everybody says.
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't understand.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Well...I don't know.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
'Fish'?
I'll be the judge of that.
I'm her father!
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Those were my words, Bill.
Does she know where she's going?
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
'...Yes --'
Death!
It just occurred to me --
I think you know --
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
How's that, Quince?
Sure.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Does Drew tell you everything?
Uh oh --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where's he going?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I've got patients coming in --
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
No, it was so right it scares me.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Whatever gets you off.
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
A cop?
You did.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Tell me about her again.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
Deals?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Kill him.
Such as?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Where is he?
Yeah, I hated it.
Why would you do that?
Don't protect him.
Help me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Did Teddy send you?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You know it?
I don't remember.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
You said you were leaving town.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Shut it, Teddy.
What's wrong with this one?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Why would I do that?						    *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Turn around.
Grieve elsewhere.
And...?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Two main players plus three.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I'll be there.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
What kind of weight?
Port-Au-Prince.
No.
Havana, Cuba...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Chill out Sonny.
I would never doubt you.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
That's right.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Do we need this...?
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
I'm scared.
Yessir, I can see that.
Where?
Don't make me laugh.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Sixty?
How much?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Just what?
Aslan, there... 
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh shit.
No!
Who?
What's your name?
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Shit.
Take a look.
H-how do I get...?
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Oh, Jesus!!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
Across both tracks!!
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Just do it!!
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
What?
What?
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
How long...?
Will I be able to walk?
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Done?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Yes.
Yes.
No big deal.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
It'll only take a second.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
The what?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
That's disgusting.
Maybe.
It will.
You don't know?
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
What? What is it?
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Well, that's good, isn't?
To do what?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Far right.
- this is very disconerting..
Do what?
You didn't do that badly.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Who wants to be decent?..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No...
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Very.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Yes, I gathered as much.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I don't.  No exactly.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Left jacket pocket?
I told her to get outta there.
Nyah still on the property?
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
By asking me.
What about him...?
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Talking's good, walking's better.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
Take off your coat.
I'm going to answer it.
You didn't have to.........
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Who else is left?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
I don't quite follow you.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Why should I?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Very well.
Tell you what?
What problem?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
I remember..
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
And get a doctor.
Of course I can hear you.
What's going on?
I always check the batteries.
Uh-huh
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Thank you, Rose.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
And that's how much I'm saying.
You're not sleepy?
I'm getting married.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I'm going to marry him.
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I was dead.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
What?
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Yeah.
I'm here!
That's right.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
Maybe you're right.
I shouldn't.
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
He's my younger brother.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
WHAT?
Where's the ring?
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Why not?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Your hair's different.
What's the matter with him?
Did you see it?
Oh.
What sins have you to confess?
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Yes.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
No.
People home.
He's a plumber.
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
You're using coconuts!
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
What do you mean?
We don't have a lord.
I am your king!
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
What is that?
No, no ... not "is"!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I move for no man.
So be it!
Had enough?
You're a looney.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

I am an enchanter.
Greetings King Arthur.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
What?
There he is!
Yes, I see.
Come on, patsy.
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
I'm getting better!
I feel happy... I feel happy.
Right.  Off you go.
What is your quest?
Here's one!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Is that clear?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.
... I Bet you're gay.
They're doctors?
You've come to rescue me?
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I didn't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
Yeah.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Mama...
By whose authority?
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Nobody has any rights over me.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Too busy looking after themselves.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Are they worth reading?
Who by?
That doesn't make him an expert.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
You can't know that for sure.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
The same, your Majesty.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Why not?
Yes, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
He?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
We are talking...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Nick, what is it.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
The game will guide you.
They fired everyone.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Will you meet with him?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Right. See ya.
Good luck, honey!
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Before what?
But, this could be serious.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Not that I can see.
"Before what?"
Okay.
But I want to.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Betty Elms.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
I just wanted to come here.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
Sure.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
I don't know.
McCay knows ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I'm not listening.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
He hired you to build this place ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Girder, watch your head.
Yeah a real shame.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Why ?
Where ?
But, he's...
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Yes sir.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
He's been expecting you.
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
The power went out in half the park.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
I meant him.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Do you want to go out with me ?
Yes.
Sure.
Shut up ! It's me.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Don't mention it.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Seriously?
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I will. How's Shelly?
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
He likes you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
I guess you have.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
TAXI!!!
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Boyfriend?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
What do you think?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
What's it for?
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Committed.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
A secret, I like that.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Okay.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Not exactly.
I mean...with your car.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Hey! Oh look.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
What's that?
Here?
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Really?
Perfect.
Then who's it for?
No, sweetie, not yet.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh come on.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
What do you get for that?
I wrote a poem too.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Do you like her?
Really?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Yes!!
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'm allergic to it.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
It's a mosquito bite.
Okay, OW!
What's wrong with your eyes?
No, I don't wanna.
You're right, let's knock it down.
Hurry!!!
Do it!
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Desperate.  To talk.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You like her.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Let's not get carried away.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
I've missed a step.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Exactly what?
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
You've met her parents.
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Endearingly absent-minded.
Waiter! Check, please!
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
No.  I've got you.
Except for that.
Yes.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... yeah, that.
The most important thing. Is being together.
... and you knew about this.
You're much more his type.
Well, that just happened that time.
I know that, Star.
You have to what?
You're so good.
How is that?
Third party?
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hal Phillip Walker.
Where the hell have you been?
Your brother?
Harvard?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
She sure sings nice.
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
What did you say?
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
No.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Who is this?
Oh.
I have to go.
I'm twenty-eight
Glad to meet you.
For him?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Who?
You bet.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Are we in a big hurry?
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Lobotomy Bay?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Aside from the obvious?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Got it.
So, what now?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Jesus...
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Waitin' in the lounge.
How 'bout Mallory?
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Tomorrow.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Don't call my men assholes.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
See Duff. He's the money man.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
You in a big hurry, boy?
No. You got the wrong idea.
What d'you think?
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Where's he at?
Any other family?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Maybe.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
But I would like to see you again.
No, on the porch.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
What d'you mean?
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
What's he like?
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
How about it?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Hmmm - good coffee.
My kids want me to teach them.
We'll be all right.
What about your boy?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
I'm Duff.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
'Don't sound so sure.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
What did you say, boy?!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Let's stay here, Will.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
What about her?
How's the villa's security?
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
What are you talking about?
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Maybe so...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Can you take me to it?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
And Linda...
Why would you want me to kill you?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Too late?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
If you say so.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Roger in Op/Ed.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Hidden camera.
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Good.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Yes, desperately.
And a gymnast!
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
So what are you thinking for college?
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Thanks. So do you.
You were attracted to me?
I finally found my story.
We're very evolved.
We went through the door...
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Just what?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Specifically.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Don't be a smart ass.
It's not the gas, Dad!
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
You got a problem with me, Grady?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
What's this?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Why won't you talk to me?
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
Eggs?
Yor dad picking the music again?
I'm sure you would.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Wait and see.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Jennifer --
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Call me Nancy.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
I'm serious.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
A sad choice.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
Of course.
Oh, stop showing off.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
I was.
Let's go in.
No, I didn't.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Don't ask.
Jesus.
You do?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Where's Bella?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Do you ever masturbate?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Which was?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
And she's in your house.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Yes.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Right!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Thank you, ma'am.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
B-B-Billy.
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Marry who?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Hey, what's that?
Lemme see...
A pecking party?
Lobotomy?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
Okay, sucker.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I said out!
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, it's cold!
He's not!
He is!
I see.
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
'Kay!
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Shhh!  This way!
Sure...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
You's better believe it, brother!
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Bet!
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Oh, yeah...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Buona notte.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Exactly.
No.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But, Faith--
Thanks.
Amazing.
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Because.  I know where he is.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Mickey Spillane.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
We were hungry.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Yeah.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I brought you that, too.
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
Yes?
Really?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
I don't know, Kate.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
I think he's having an affair.
It's still the new year...
Does Dwayne know about this?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
You're coming with me?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Are you sure?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
I never even got to be single.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Nope.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I'd love to.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
That's really romantic.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
But my own kid bro—
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Hello, Edie.
Tommy, what happened?
I'm with Terry.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
How do you like it?
You haven't finished your beer.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Get away from me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Thanks just the same.
He's going to have to grow up too.
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
A question of who rides who.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
I can? Okay.  Okay...
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Such as what?
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
You'll work.
Raise a hand to me and... .
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Take it easy now, Terry.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
What do you mean?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Then..then what's that music?
Something's making that music.
Be careful!--They'll see you.
You do?
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
It would seem so, Master
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Oh, if there is only time!
Your pleasures of course!
Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaaahhhh.
What do you suppose for?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
No, thanks.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Thank you.
His assistant.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Sure looks that way.
Now you're talkin'.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Just hung up.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I saw Karen Sisco.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
That's all I wanted to know.
They're in 7D.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Let's go outside and talk.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
So you've done this before, huh?
Hey.  You learn from doing.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
I can go to the bar.
He killed a police officer.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You know.
Okay.  How many going out?
Must be a real soft pillow.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
You gonna write me a check?
That time?
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
What?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
I can tell.
You're not my type.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
What're you doing at Glades?
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I'd like that.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
None I'd like to share.
It's possible.  Why?
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
He did.
Power dive!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Yeah.
What facts are those?
So what are you saying?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Sorry to trouble you.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
How did you?...
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
God help them.
Fook ya!
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Go on. You can do it.
What happened?
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
But what has to be different?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
That's real big of you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
What?
Come back to me.
I'm trying.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
I hate chickens.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What?
That would be impossible.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
I'm home now.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
For what?
What does Charlie think about that?
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Okay. I promise.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Wbat're you talking about?
When do we start?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Like what?
What will they be made of?
Silicon is from sand.
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
It sucked.
I still can't believe she's dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
I'm not burying him here...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
I miss him too...
Charles is right behind me.
Bailey, Brackman.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with your face?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
What's that mean?!
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Whatever.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
As in, the vegetable?
Rayisha. Very nice.
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Sure. It's fine.
Thank you.
Except... you were gay?
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Sure thing.
What can I do?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
No. I can't really see it.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Where's Dad?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Thank you.
Yes.
Your earrings?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Not especially.
How did you do that?
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
He was doing a great job.
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Had it with deals.
Think about what?
Get out of our way.
Audrey?
As fast as you can.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Hey, me. Over here.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Wha'?
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
For your own fear.
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
There is no "safe."
Which half?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
I'm born-again.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Well, maybe they're not.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Yo!
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Let's take a look.
I want her.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Then you admit --
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Of course.
He doesn't know.
Where?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
Over here!
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
You know what I'm talking about!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Well..
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Do you think I don't?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He got in here how?
I don't.
That's putting it mildly.
I'm different. I like it fine.
Dance? Here?
All right--following me.
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
No percentage in that.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mine?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
I don't want to talk.
To do what?
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Who told you my name?
A private joke.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
A little something on account perhaps?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
Men like you don't need orders.
Go live in a tent.
Open it and count it.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Positive?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
It does.  May I go now? 
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
So-so.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
How long have you had it?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
We'll see you next week, and if--
What went wrong?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Well, you know...
Too late.  Just my luck.
In radio we're different.
Well, you should.
To the airlift.
And the Argies.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Far too long.
Fuck off.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Okay, I will.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
I'm not here.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Darling Susan.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
What?
Caught my first tube this morning.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
The fucking punks are surfers.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
Shrimp and fries.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
You're kneeling on my hand.
We're not going.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I'll take him.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
I can't tell.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
You've got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Not exactly.
New York.
What motel you staying at?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
What's your name, lover.
Edward... you got it!
You know how to drive a stick?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Diet coke.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I sell them.
What?  Why?
Where'd you learn to do this?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
The Rex.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Oooh!
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Why not?
No.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
What if someone tries to steal it?
Where are you taking me!?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
What do you mean?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm up.
Give me twenty minutes.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I pray for that.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
You'll like it fine.
Professionally?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I was in here yesterday.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Should I be?
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I thought I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
I don't think more than ten.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
But you don't know where he is.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Shall we track them both?
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Nothing comes to mind.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
No one of consequence.
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Yes.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
You're going to jump on me.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
I already have.  Come on.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
Only if we ask him.
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Come on.  Let's get going.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
We can't play today?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
No.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
Or arrived with her.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
I live there. Alone.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Don't you know?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Huh?
No.
She haven't even called you?
I feel better when you feel better.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
You'll never find it.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Contemplate your... panic button.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
You're not.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
I believe it.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Sam!
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
No.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
All right.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Is there?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
No need to apologize...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
No!  Good night!
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Meaning what?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
No kiddin'.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
It's all yours.
What do you mean police dog?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Horsefeathers!
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
He can't hear you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
But how would you find him?
Well... maybe...
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I'll be right back.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Is that all?
So am I.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
I'm not blubbering.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
What do you think of her, honey?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Mine.
No, you're not.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Galley what?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
She looks terrible, just awful.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Afraid of the hospital?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
I had better call Daddy.
Be quiet, Rose.
But... I love him.  I do...
Incestuous.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Who cares?
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
What... ?
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Stop blaming yourself.
Dean Martin.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You're lying...
We've got the tape to prove it.
Maybe.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Absolutely.
Gimmie a minute.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
I can't see.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Wouldn't miss it.
Oh... great!
All set.
Here's the terminal.
Good, I hate long waits.
Proper?!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Your Royal Highness.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
On my mother's grave.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet
Yes.
Oh Brad.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
It's alright Janet.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Makes you cry
Was all I had to say
No no no no.
No no no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
It's not that --
I'll be waiting.
Yeah...
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
What's happenin' here?
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
That's it.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Yeah.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Do I have to pay juice?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Hey --
Stuff it, man!
Maybe I like garbage.
I said, how ya feelin'?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Yeah.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
...The guy's great.
...Yeah.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Absolutely...
It don't bother me none.
I'll do okay.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
The story -- what's happenin'?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Maybe --
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Toon cops worked me over.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
A joker to the end.
Eddie, come on.
Wait here...
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
Doom.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
No, it's not.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Yeah...
Good idea.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
But new struck cuz.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out--
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
I'll not endure him.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Is she a Capulet?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Just business.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
Do you have the material?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
What's that?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Call it a reckoning of character.
You seem one to me.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Is that right?
Something like that...
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Like Larry or Swede.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Gregor's cell phone...
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
You don't have to do this.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
It's my job.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
No you don't, and you know it.
Would you stop with that...
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
What?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Don't lie to me!!!!
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Hell, it won't be us!
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
What's that?
He saw everything!
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
He would have done it to us, right?
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
You killed him...
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
OK.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
You know I do.
What did he buy?
Yeah.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Uh...C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Then what the hell are you all about?
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you can't have it.
Hi.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
That's great Earl!
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Not in the trunk.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
No, sir.
Two-hundred thousand!
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
Lee, you okay?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
No.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
I am a tourist.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
I have plenty of dates.
Who?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
No.  She's a school teacher.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Follow the Rich White Man?
No.  It's not right.
Why did you help me?
What's a Chinese heaven?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No mu-shu.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Follow me my Asian brother.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Are you okay, Lee?
Ricky Tan?
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
Tell me about it.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Right....
Don't go there...
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
I'm sorry.
You know him?
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Do it!
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Yes.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
You bet ya, Coach.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Oh, please!
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
You can turn that finger around.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Of what?
Excuse me?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I kissed him back.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I'm listening.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
It's for the bell.
Not eight...
Yeah.
It sounds nice.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
What?
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
I should say something in this about magic.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
So I mailed your letter.
M.F.E.O.?
What about the letter?
I love the symphony.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
What's she talking about?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Where's your mom?
She died.
I don't know --
It is not --
Yeah.  What's that?
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
What?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Whose show was this on?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Jonah!
Everyone at work heard you.
Victoria? She's okay.
This is the one I like.
Did too.
No.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
You could have called me --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
No thanks.
You haven't tried locking them up!
I don't make policy.
It never ends.
So much the better.
An American.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
What makes you so sure?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
No.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
You know I don't think that.
Forgot what?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You've got to help around the house!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
No, Why?
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Then leave.
You don't understand.
That's long enough to get out of town.
What happened to your eye?
It's the only way to play.
It gets me through the day.
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
I just can't. Okay?
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Danny, it's not what you think.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
My features. They're Finnish.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Palmdale
He doesn't have one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
When? When did you ever see me use?
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Make me an offer.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Big Bill.
Okay! Okay!
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Answer the fucking question!
What's he holding?
Turns out he's connected.
And what does this have to do with me?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Again, I thank you.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Why are you doing this?
Better than drugs.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
No kidding.
You must be a hell a shot.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Shut up, will you?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Beasley's dead.
I've got a line on one.
Yup, hell of a mission.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
And how do you bluff yourself?
You want me to take over?
Out of the mouth of babes.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
But, sir...
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
HERE THEY COME!
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
And Sarge?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
This evening is over.
Hey, sis.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
I dream about it.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Oh yeah!
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Goodnight.
Now why can't I tell the story?
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Bon voyage.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Pardon me?
Eight.
Would you hold this for me?
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Sure I do.
What?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Job?  Being a great date.
Then call me later.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Yeah.  With potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Right.
You need to study?
You told your dad?
One more time would be nice.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
No.
The truck?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
No way.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
I love you man.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Oskar, please -
It's a beautiful city.
It's bad business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
When?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
This is not my problem.
Yeah, okay.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
And killing.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
They arrived, can you believe it?
There will be generations because of what you did.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
What now?
You're sure about this two person thing?
I won't.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
I heard a noise.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Cici. Who's this?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Good for you.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Finish what my son started.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
No, it's not.
Good question. You took the bait.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
C'mon. Let's go.
Whatever.
That's not the way we play the game.
It's what you want from me.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Gotta.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
Where you going?
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Who is this?
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
There's more.
And who would that be?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Did you request this case?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Catch him, or kill him.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Is that a threat?
The killer called her.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Off the record.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
I am Gale Weathers!
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
They're the ones who approved it.
Yeah.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Huh, fine.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Who the fuck is this?
And if you get it right -- you die.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Now that it's out of your system.
Oh it did?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Oh Sidney...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Are you alone in the house?
Who are you trying to reach?
It happens. Take it easy.
So why did you dial it again?
I don't think so.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Dial someone else, okay?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
No... please.
Your call.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll get my camera.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
How is everything?
How is she?
Have you contacted the bureau?
Yes, sir.
Casey? Casey?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Has his story changed?
And why would she do that?
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
And why is that?
That's the original part.
Working, thank you.
Twice.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
He came to make up.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Later.
Whatever. Just hurry.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
Tits -- see.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Good.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
What the hell's going on?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
Okay...
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
It's not too far away now.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You should be thanking me.
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
For now.
What?
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
What about sports?
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Bear with me.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
Oh, it's alright.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Then, he must write about these murders.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Oh... um, William.
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
I don't sleep very well.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
How should I know?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
I ain't wearing no gun.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Yes sir...
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
How many, would you say?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
I'm Clayton.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Because she's my...my...
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
What's the sense in it!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I got to fetch her home...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Yes, daddy.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
We just have to make a new beginning.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Just call me Elisabeth.
And the title of this piece?
Lady?
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
You're a liar.
No, your marriage bed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
So now you are free to love
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
So what do we do?
How?
What happened to Sam?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
What? Who?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I will.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"She speaks.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
You admire it?
Will Shakespeare!
If they find you here they will kill you.
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
You flatter, my lord.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
But what of Lord Wessex?
In the same fashion as chess.
You're a bad loser.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
But not quite.
Can we talk about something?
How much did you pay?
How much?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know.
So I gathered.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Well?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes, thanks.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Yes.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
-- instead of what he is --
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
What? What's wrong?
Don't.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
And now you tell me.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Then let's spend some money.
We could put it somewhere.
I'll wait there.
Everything.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
You mean I can have the room?
Downstairs.
Did you ever kill a man?
If I think you're lying --
Here.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
A certain weakness.
I write about it?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Yeah, I think so.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
But you don't know what happened.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
It isn't?
I do her hair, yeah.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
No.
I am not like my mother!
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
You do know what money's like these days.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
I don't know. Probably not.
No, thanks.
Probably the bathroom.
Yeah, I think so...
Whew.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
I won't screw you up.
Yeah?
Well, did you or didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
You don't think so? I do.
-- what?
Not me, pal.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
What?
-- Oh yeah.
-- how did you get here?
Okay!
What're you talking about?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Now, George --
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
George?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Go where?
Okay.
Going where?
Neither do I, baby.
A business meeting, I told you that.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Television or movies?
I'm very tired, George.
-- yes.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
They're not?
When?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
See she doesn't drink too much.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.

I'll call you back.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
Somebody's mother.
Then you were talking to him.
Of course not.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's right.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I know, I'm sorry.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- uhh-huhh...
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
That's right.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Sort of.
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
Do you have children?
Everybody but us.
Yes, Dad.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
What?
Yeah.
Tony.
Try to think what it was.
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
No.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
It's okay, really.
Sure.
That's right, sir.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Grady... oh.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
All right, sir.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Your money's no good here.
Hmm, nice.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Good.
I think he did it to himself.
Yes...
Give me the bat.
Get down.
Go away.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Oh, it sure would be
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Royalty?
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Will you marry me, Jane?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Was it a prescription?
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
No.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Well... thank you.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
SING!
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
You bastard!
Sure.
What is it, Betty?
Oh my! 
Just about.  Show me again.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
What a shame!
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
What?
Five a.m.?
Three years.  Sister.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Experience!  Right?
Right.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
We're nuns!
They're from my old convent.
Don't you know it!
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
You were unhappy?
Sit down.
Your cigarette -- out.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Check your driver's license.
I'm outta here.
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
But...
I'm a Christian.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Yeah, like what?
Oh-huh.
They open a window.
You won't even tell us?
Who are you guys?
We didn't tell you what?
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
Willy -- hit the lights.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Measles.
Which convent was that, Sister?
She's our inspiration!
Christy.
But where?
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Find 'em!
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
I hit him square.
I was afraid of this.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Pardon me?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
At times I do.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
What kind of nuts?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Listen.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
We should go.
Why this tree?
Man or woman?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What books?
Take the reins.
He has proposed to me twice.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
He moves too fast.
Use caution.
What did you say?
Yes.  Here...
In a way, yes.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Father saw you die.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Sure.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
What you got that's good to eat?
What you got in there, warshing?
It's too big.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
I hate you!
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
They let you out?
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Two people.
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Where'd you get them flowers?
You want to go with me?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
I don't reckon I know.
Yeah.
Why?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
So it died when it come out?
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
It was still alive when you buried it?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
I reckon.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Okay.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Mama?
I love you, too, Mama.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
I reckon.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Okay.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I've heard it said that way.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
No, we have to get this story.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Will he be supervised?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Do me a favor, will you?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
I'm all ears.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Lovely.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Open it.
What difference does it make?
Huh?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Those are pretty hostile words.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Hi there, little brother.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
What do you want me to say?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Why don't you go to the police?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
The end.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I'm not going to do it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
It is.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection!  Speculation.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Oh, yes.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Won't take two.
You're right.  I better use two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Maybe...?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
And what do you believe?
What else could it be?
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
It's entirely mutual.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
You've flipped your wig!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave our legs, stupid.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
WHAT?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
What engagement present?
Shut up and keep packing.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Honey - she called me honey.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
I'm a very sick girl.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
What's the big idea?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
You invest in shows?
This is where I get off.
Who?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
You can't trust those guys.
Really?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Just my feminine intuition.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Thank you.
You have a yacht?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
It's the thought that counts.
Three?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
What happened?
Talk about sad.
Why?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Let's make it an even million.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Tomorrow night?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
You shave with your spats on?
Thanks, Charlie.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Hey.
Actually, I do.
Still--
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
And Kat was fully clothed.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
You’re funny.
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
It’s my job.
Spontaneously combust?
I have to.  I’m the best man.
Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You want me to let him in?
Ahoy!
It’s complicated, Dad.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
But where is my daddy!?
She was dirty and wet...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
It was too dark, Daddy.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Goodnight to you, son...
Thank you, Daddy...
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Same as we -- they pray.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
No mam -- I looked all over.
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
I'll wait till after the children.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Behold my glory.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Doggy.
Very funny!
Sheet!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
YOU DO?!
No way.
Help yourself prickfuck!
I know what it is!
I don't know.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Papa mama simi.
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mrph mprph!!
Aw, ma!!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Yeah, I guess.
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Yeah!
I don't know, dude.
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
I'll just try the first one.
Are you sure, Kenny?
Oh God... What have I done...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You would know, dummy.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Yup.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Oh yeah...
Anna...
I'm sure I will.
I did nothing to the monitors.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's me.
Over and out!
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
I understand.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I'll do my best.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
No, just enjoying the view.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Baby, take it easy.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
I'm from Akron.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Nope.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
It was a clearance.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Wish me luck.
I'm not on the tour this year.
They suspended me for 100 years.
That game was before you was born.
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I gotta survive.
No...
I didn't think so.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Hello, mom?
Uh...over easy.
Who's there?
What did you do to Buzz?
No!
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What if he wants to get out?
Why would you help me?
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Where can I find him?
Isn't this technically a scooter?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No. Not at the present.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
We'll get into that later.
Plan B is your dad.
Nothing.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
...lane six. Yes.
Why should I help that old fuck.
You got any broken bones?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You're really pissing me off.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Lips still for sale?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Do you see it?
What team?
What?
What do you mean, he's missing?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
-- and then brought her down here --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
What am I -- a dog, now?
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Jerry?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Yes, Harry.
It's not ignorant.
She's not gonna know.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
You went through Edmunds' things?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You told him about me?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
You don't trust me?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
Wait a second --
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Manifested?
What?
How can the sphere do that?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Parasolutrine?
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
Only lab rats.  Here.
I'm feeling better.
Did you?
That's when you went in the sphere.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For whoever's in that thing.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Wait a second, I --
Not a clue.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
No.  I didn't say that.
What are you still doing here?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
What is it, Harry?
What happened to her?
That's right.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
But it's impossible.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Beth and Harry?
Told me what?
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Like what?
Try this one.
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Unless it's an act.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Who's going to pay me then?
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
May the Force be with you.
Not any more!
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Forget it, son.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
It's automatic.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
It's what I deserve.
What do I want with a scar ?
Not enough, I guess.
We're the old men, Ace.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Yes, sir !
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
I don't know, Zander.
Is it true ?
Who ?
Why not ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
I'll meet you outside.
You two have so much in common.
Shhh...
Should I be ?
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Thank you, ma'am.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Hi, mom.
You can never be sure.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
What is your position ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Who's that with you ?
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Granted.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Mr Decker....
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
This served the purpose.
Twelve seconds...!
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Viewer ahead, sir.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
It's in your play.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, no, I see...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
That whole...
...I always thought so...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
I...
No, I don't...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
...lost the screw...
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
I used to go out with a politician.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
...yes.
No, that's true.
I'd love to.
Yes...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
I saw...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
I'll knit you a sweater.
That's so beautiful...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...they run on water.
This horse is booked.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I don't eat vegetables.
Sure, what have you got?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
You mind...?
I'm ready!
Mr. Barrenger.
If there's anything I...
I, uh...  Um...
I, actually yes.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, yes, but...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I know...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Doug...
You were in the car with Bob?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Mmmm.  You have children?
I had a witness I would.
What?
You bet he did.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Why?
You want me to lie.
No.
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
I...
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
My oh my.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Sherry, this...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I want them thrown in jail.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
So we just got lucky.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I don't care.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
It happens.
During sex.
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
What are you gonna talk about?
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
She is but an arriviste.
Not with my mouth open.
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
See, I...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
That doesn't bother me.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Alright starve.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Oh.
You dying.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
And when did that pass?
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
I'm worried.
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
Not to me.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
I live or I die.
A lot smaller.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Fine, forget it.
Jackie?
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It's the same choice you made.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
No, there isn't.
Because you've changed so much.
Does Jackie know this?
He isn't.
Thank you.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
No.
I did not go to high school.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Who is Jesus?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but –
I'm going in there.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Nigger.
I hate reading.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
So what's going on?
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah.
OK. Bye.
Yeah. I know.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Well get someone down there!
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Yes, you should.
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
Excellent...excellent!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
I have your word, Mister President?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
What are you talking about, Major?
What?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
General Schmuck?
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Yes, sir.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Plan-R????
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
How much soda, sir.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Forget it.
That's what I said.
You tell me.
Why should they call us back?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Then get off my back!
I'm okay.  What's up?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Sure, King.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
It's really not about anything.
And your mom.
What?
It's your birthday?
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
No, I mean, no one.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Yeah.
Shit.
Buff is funny. God.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
This is private property, my friend.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, So what about her?
You could do it.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Really?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Who were you talking to?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Yes.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
That's right.
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
I know, I know, I know.
No.
Yes.
About things that are important to me.
I'm talking about idealism.
How?
And?
Mm-mm.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Go.
Just go.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Really?
For a while.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You do not!
You're not serious.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Me?
Really? What else does your mother say?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
It's none of my business?
If you hit me...
At least I have a point of view, you know?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Yeah.
Trix...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Well, I want to know what happened --
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
They could kill you.
My best friend got pregnant.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
In a deep freeze.
Close, but no cigar.
What's wrong with it?
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Why should you do that?
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
We're engaged.
You're tough, all right.
So do I.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
It will?
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
I don't want it now.
No.
Nobody asked you to.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
We've missed you too, dear.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
Why?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know.
What month?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There sure is.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Okay.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Just follow me.
Who?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I ran into some people I knew.
Good.
I think I'll read a little.
You think I made that up about the gun...
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Wipe your feet!
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Uh-huh?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
But which one?
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
What's that?
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
But why?
But I don't understand.
What?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
Well, there's several ways to go .
Nurse!
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Nurse! Help !
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh, sure.
Did anybody notice you?
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Can you create life?
You sure?
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
No, MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
That's home.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Better than when I was a child.
Mr. Roebush?
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Uh-huh.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Kitchen. . . Technician
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
What about this week's check?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Columbia.
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Is this whitemail?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
We gonna crash?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Sister! I'm his sister!
We've already met.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
But the other night...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
I do?
Maybe I could try --
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
I was right. you are Superman.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
What else could I do?
Does Lois know about this yet?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Genius!  --  Lex.
Wrong.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
He has powers as we do . . .
Australia.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
		DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
We must combine our strength.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Absolutely!
I'll try. . .
Go on . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
This wasn't in the plan.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Got it? Otis?
I know.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I'd better get you down.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
So I've noticed.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready.
You?! How about me?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
All of us.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I gave him steady employment --
It is for me.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
And garbage doors.
They'll soon be over.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
What happened?
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Why?
I don't know.
Oh.  Right.
It does concern me.
Billy, that's too early.
They can look forward to that.
I better get back.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Excuse me?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Yes.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
No.  A little sugar though.
It's interesting.
Who's Mr. Stephens?
Did he say what about?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Nicole?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Okay.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
I'm absolutely positive.
There's the Prescots...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
News?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Who are you?
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
In what way?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Why were you scared?
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Nothing.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Great.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
There's talk of that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
But of course...
I only had a few hours.
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
J.J., Steve isn't...
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
He means that much to you...?
No, I won't...
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I don't think so.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
This sort of thing!
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Why?
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Trust me.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No!  Don't kill him!
Uh huh.
I know, Mom.  I know.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
I'm very sorry.
Yes.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
What museum?
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Yes, I know who he is.
I have no idea.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
When you got to the crescendo.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Sure.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Like this bandleader.
Come to the office, please.
You're late.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Freezing.
You'll learn.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
I want it to be over for you.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Oh, Kyle.
Call her.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
What?
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
You pull me up.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
You're the one who started running.
Can we talk?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
What are you talking about... ?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What?
Get us out!
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Fuck you.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I didn't know what else to call you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Never better.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
Why?
I know...
What's this all about, Connie?
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Yeah.
Yes.
Humor me with specifics.
It's all down to this...
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
No.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Sam...  Thank you.
Attempted murder.
You warm my heart.
What?
It's a question.
Maybe someday.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Sure.
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
It's okay... we're all here...
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Who?
Mrs. Dudley.
Fifteen dollars.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
I know.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Not for you, clearly.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
Because --
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
It was better than a telegram.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Too easy?
What post office?
Probably.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Ashamed.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
It didn't discourage you, though.
Get seven years, did you?
What about your grandmother?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
How do you know?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
How we gonna get that lucky?
What do you think?
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
He didn't say that.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
I don't understand.
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
And how do we share--
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Huh?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Mm.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
It was Big Dave's.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
So--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Jesus...
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
What the hell are you talking about?
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Birdy...
You also have an interest in the securing property?
No thanks, I--
Hello.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Uh... you're under arrest.
I'm in.
Why not?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
You're kidding.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Everybody.  Get behind me.
May I see that?
Dr. Green has to see you!
I hope you liked it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
I'm not giving up.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Like this.
You're color blind.
Holy mother, what is that?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Eats them?
Okay.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Would you mind showing it to me?
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium!
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
The answer's right in front of us.
What?
<i>Fiji.</i>
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
You want to book the flight?
What music?
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Who?
Oh, God.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
What's the hurry?
--we need more charcoal.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Do something...
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Well, thank you for your help.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
When was that?
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
No. Don't bother.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Old friend of your father's.
You a reporter?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
That's what I'm saying.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
What did it look like?
Did you find something?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Something sweet.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
I'd been told as much.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
Yeah, well they may this one.
Run.
On whose orders?
And they want to blame us?
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
How deep does this go?
I'm not taking any chances.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Yes.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Driver.
How?
My life is over.  Go.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
What happened?
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Then what is he?
If you believe that.
What happened to Charles Gish?
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
No problem.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Completely unaware.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
In German?
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Yes.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Keep the packet.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Where's Harry?
I don't want it.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Where?
Just around the corner.
No, not yet.
No.
September '39.
He was...
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Getting around, Martins.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
A bruised lip.
Bring him in.
I'm not asking you to.
This is where he vanished.
Fifty yards right down there.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Well, there's not much time.
Take him to Sacher's.
This way, miss.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
It's good to see you, Holly.
And - Anna...
You wouldn't do anything.
You can get somebody else...
Sure...
Zwei zwartze.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
I have guests waiting.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Something wrong.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Why?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Fuck off.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Yes.
People still need values, beliefs....
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
That's stupid. Why would they?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Fuck that.
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
I'll go look....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
What about Curtis Zampf?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Notice? Like what...?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
This is me.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
I don't do that.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Steve...
I've got to get back to the --
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Who told you that?
Isn't it true?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
The mother.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Why me?
What are you trying to say?
Obviously.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
He's training.
No...
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
What?
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Why?  Are they what's most important?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
... I was right about what?
No... in the hut.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Give it to me.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
It's me... Johana.
You'll understand.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
You called the police?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Coffee might be nice.
... Yes?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
What's your first move?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Oh. Okay.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
I sleep it off.
Sure.
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
That's right, of course.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
Why?
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
You're too good to me.
And did you find the leopard?
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
I know. Funerals.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
How do you know?
We will ——
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that easy?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
...We’re turning in circles.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
Emily...
Have we done business before?
Yeah.
So, what are you looking for?
You... Fuck you!
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
What company?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
How are you, Jane?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Yes. How did...
What if it is?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Anything at all?
Does it matter?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is?
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
An Austrian.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Can I get up now?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Is she on the phone?
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Mossad?
It’s a good guess...
What do you think?
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
What do you mean?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Majesty, I can't...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
What... what do you mean?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
No, but...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
It would not be the same without you.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
Why?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
And when was that?
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Guess.
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
But where are you going to be?
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Not long ago...
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
You think?
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
20,000 gold crowns.
Yes... they were.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Damn right!
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
No...!
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
No.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why would they?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Oh yes... very.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes, it is.
Him?
Why did she have to die?
Yes.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Wladek, please.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
He'll be here soon.
Just over a year.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
I know.
What did you pay him?
You'll be deported.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Bitch!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Out of Warsaw.
In the attic.
We're getting out.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch your feet!
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Yes, I suppose you would.
Nothing just yet
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
Everyone has to practice.
A piano?
It must come.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I had some appointments.
You think my play is bad?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
We'll be waitin'.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Hackers.
I can talk, can't I?
Lonnegan after you, too?
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Lonnegan.
2:00 A.M.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.
Yeh, he knows that.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
For fifteen years.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose.....  ?
You better take a drink.
You've got to get your mind off this.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Go away!
Oh, here she is.
No.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
And I'll give then proof!
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
She... she fell over backwards.
Don't lie to me.
Forgive me.  How are you?
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
What's that to you?
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Trail him!  Trail who?
He did!
Did you go?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
I couldn't go near that woman.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I never had it.
Never mind.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
They'll want more than your word for that.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
If you like 'em like that.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
We need ice.
Yes.
Want a drink?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Did I give it to you?
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Sit down!
Maybe I will.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I did find him!
Yes!
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Yes.
Why are you saying it?
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
No, Mr. Charles.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
I just wanted to tell you...
You did.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
No, please, not again.
Wha...
He's not so--
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
What about it?
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
You said he was a deserter.
No.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
...I know.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Just be cool.
Epps...
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Where the hell is it!?
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
What are we going to do?
Shi'ites, I think.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What?
He's going to slow down.
The photos.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Yeah, you're funny.
It doesn't mean anything.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
We got to get out of here.
Then lets go back while we still can.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I think we found something.
He lived through that?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Look,dirt!
It's 3+27 hundred
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
Right now.
What kind of answer is that?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
No......  She's dead THX........
Look more closely.
What do you want?
I thought of something.....
Yes...
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Go ahead.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Where...?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Bingo!
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Why do you do it?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Your partner?
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
How do you know?
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
"Punks", huh?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
I know. I warned them.
Alex, please.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Sir, I--
Goddamit, Reilly--
I promised her she'd be safe.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
Amsterdam?
No.
No!
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No--proud. Very proud!
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston!
The fourteenth of May.
Seven and nine!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
He recognized you!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Lily-- 
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That's what you need!
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
As you like. 
Yes!
Right!
Ye-es?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
I know all your tricks.
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
I <u>believe</u> you.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
No--I'm sorry.
That's right.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
The ship will sink.
You're certain?
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
Can I bum a cigarette?
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Bollocks.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
No.
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
No, no! Just with her hands.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
We'll find out.
Right.
I'm so cold.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Sure!
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Will you leave me alone?
We'll save you a place at our table.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Get moving--
Not at all.
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Good-by.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Married?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Now you're talkin'!
Thank you, sir. 
I'll take one. 
Where did you hide it?
Three Jacks.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Sure.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
So what?
She's in New York.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Is this your gun?
Everything O.K.?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Do what--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I'll never love anybody else.
Somebody's got to do it--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Get that out of your trunk.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
About twelve hundred.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Then why did you run away?
Oh, so that's it...
Maybe even my destiny.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Come and get him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
You retired, too?
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Enough?  Never.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Sorry...
I don't.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
What?
Good God, you're really-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
How would you know?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I hate Sadie.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
None of my business, Fred.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
So why did you leave?
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Just hold me.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Hey - the world is my office.
No.
I didn't think so.
You too.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Think about mom.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
Don't say it.
... Yes?
And number two?
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Since when?
I ought to break your damn neck.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Babe Brother.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
Now who are we talking about?
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Here!  In the car!
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Sorry.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Shield your eyes!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
But why would Andy want me?
Hold still, Buzz!
Not today!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
A lunchbox...?!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
You murdering dog!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Uh-oh.
Sid!!!
It's busted.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
There's not.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I did like the music.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
It was only a mouthful!
So did I.
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
Well, I hope it stays that way.
He's not here.
Nine thousand dollars.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
How much do I pay him?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
I was just waiting for the right time.
Goodbye Arnie.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Are you going to?
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Sixteen
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
What is this, like freebase?
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Then here's a little bump.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
So go shower already.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
No.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
He'll do what I say.
It could mean that, yes.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
Oh, man --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Agents who died in the field.
I'm sorry.
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Can you not go yourself.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
I'm going home.
Come on.
Easy for you to say.
Certainly not.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Too young for what?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Oh, really?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Aye.
No, I'm clean.
But try too hard --
Nightmare.
Try this.
Another dab?
Screenwriter?
The park?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
What's wrong, Allison?
Say something, Mark, say something --
You're all hear.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Well, it's up to you.
That's hardly a substitute.
Why, thank you.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
But where?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
You doubt me?
Plotting our new course.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Have the Klingons responded?
It's all I have.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
But he does seem familiar?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
How do you know?
I am here, Captain.
"c."... "k."
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?


Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
No. I will not.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Want one?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Hello, Alan.
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Yeah, I... oops!
Stranger and stranger...
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
How 'bout yourself?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Recognizers!
Alan-One...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
But-what if I can't...?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
She's having an affair.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
The purse is still at the house.
You know about that?
I wasn't cheating!
Good thinking, honey.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
God, you have great legs.
What?
Yes.
As much as you used to?
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
Dance?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Fuck you.
Yes.  Go ahead.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I'm married!
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
Hello, Alabama.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
This is great, we got cable.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
The letter he sent.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Is that your real name? Really?
How 'bout me what?
Turn-offs?
That's a long time.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
You will?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Thank you.
What?
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
What?
Why Cancoon?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
It's great to hear from you.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
It'll get ya high.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Elliot Blitzer.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
No.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Nope.
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I got some money I can give you -
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Uh, what?
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
What kind of information?
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
You wouldn't understand.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
Lock it now!
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
You know -- your plan.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Who am I supposed to shoot?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Might be tight.
What do you want for free?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Same back at you.
That's my morning's pay.
It will.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Just a car.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
You got beer?
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Accident.
You're not from around here, are you?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Like you.
Such as?
Still playing?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
We'd have to kill him.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
No.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
But I want to say with you,
No.  I swear it.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
John Stewart.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I do.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
What should I do?
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
No.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Two-hundred dollars.
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're too quick for me.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
I don't understand what the--
I didn't do anything.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
I did?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
It's the truth, Jake.
What are you talking about!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Get away from me!
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Darrell--
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Two-hundred.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
I'm just going to my car?
You should be more careful.
You've been around.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Those are white words, not ours.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Try me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
But we all need that too. Hold him.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Beck's.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
No.
I have a lock on the door.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
Yes. Is this David?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
You use your sleeve.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
We're supposed to be honest.
Think carefully?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
I won't make any noise.
There's nothing to do.
All of it.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Why?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Innocent of what?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Oh. How long I been here?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Is... is it... loaded?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Jesus!
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
You missed him? You didn't...?
After a ways.
He's in there.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
You can shoot him.
First one I ever killed.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
You sure you ain't armed?
Yeah?
This Kid, what's he like?
Well, she...
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Yeah.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Did you hear what he just said?
County. I was in for fraud.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
If you'll just let me -
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
Not if we do it my way.
What if I
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What about Redfoot?
You didn't know.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
What?
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,

Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I don't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Because he was my friend.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
Why lie about everything else, then?
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
Four cases in three years ...
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
...I was one of a group of...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
When she...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
...What difference would...
Yes.
Why?
The most respected ...
I understand.
... that's perfectly all right.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Why is that?
Are you done?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
Missus...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
And are they going to get it?
Do you want me to go...?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What are you going to do?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
...I have to stand up for her...
Right.
The 'History'...?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
I did.
It's a long road that has no turning.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, the roving nurse...
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Let me come in.
Why?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Okay.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Don't go.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No, it's not right.
But why?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Ernie's?
All in good time.
How does it work?
No! Let me go!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Do you remember where you were?
Why?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
No.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Some people prefer it.
No.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How can you be sure?
Why?
Only silence. It's always like this.
No.
No, thank you.
Why did you jump?
What?!
Vaguely...
I know.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
All the time.
Only this far.
Tell me.
Too late... there's something I must do...
Let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I had to quit, Midge.
It's where you belong.
Normal.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Nothing to tell.
I'll take you home.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Think?  Well, what do you think?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Naturally.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Can we have it by tonight?
You're an asshole.
You go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What are you doing?
Have you ever done this before?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
I can't do this.
It has worked.
They're driving me nuts!
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
The groom?
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
What did you ask me?
Take care of business.
Now?
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
It's my fucking opinion.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
Not really, no.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
The wedding cake check?
Florist?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
What are you talking about?
He's a great chef.
I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Honey I don't have the time...
Do you love me?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Okay. Okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You did all right dad.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I just want her to be happy.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
What is it?
Yup.
What?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
A move?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
What song?
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Yes, it is.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Whatever you like.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
But why? Why?
What are you going to do?
You're happy, aren't you!
Where's the dough?
Things seem to be getting better.
Very, very?
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Today, a good girl.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
I wish we could hear them.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Where's my gun?
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I need your help--
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Enough to level an entire city block.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I understand... I understand perfectly.
What's wrong with Parker?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
John died.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Nothing.
You know I am.
Tell him.
Authority still makes me nervous.
Both.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
That, or living through him...
Why's that?
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What can it hurt.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Wilfred, that's not bad.
...twelve years.
Oh, Lord....
No, no, no...
What rig?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
What's it gonna cost? 
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...they sound what?
Precisely.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
8 days and we bring it back home....
...they just hadn't thought it through...
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Out in Oklahoma.
Heavy weather East of here.
Whaddaya think?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'll play your silly game.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
W...what?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
I saw it on TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
The Albanian Campaign.
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
It's too clean.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
See y'at the Finish Line.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
They don't know what's going on!
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Start unloading.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Whatever night you like.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
What was that?
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
He never told me...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...I can't even see it...
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I don't understand.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Allright. Wait here...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I don't.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
I can't...and I won't.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Ok toots, I will.
Thank you Jenkins
Have a nice day  sir
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Oh that explains everything.
Hi there Sarah
Well divide 18 into three
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
No, he wouldn't.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
What?
Then why did you?
Fine.
Yes, but...
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Right.  I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
She's making this up.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
You got it.
Jody, no...
...no...no...no...
The planchette?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Please.
I can't believe this is happening.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Norman Spencer.
Don't.
Fine.
You know what I mean.
I'll be there.
Did she say that?
To make sure she's all right.
I know.
Promise?
Did you call the police?
Of course.
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
What am I looking at?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Norman...
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
Call ya later.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Since when?
STOP IT!
Huh.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
Two what...?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
Every day  twice.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Who the hel1 -
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Help us.  Do what you can.
He just went out like & light-
I bring her flowers too.
It's too soon to know.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I do not understand...
Rowan...
Harder...
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
He fools around with his patients too.
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Captain's orders.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
That's not funny.
Your beneficence.
Lock the door.  Lock it
I don't know.
What were you talking about...?
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
On which planet...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
I like him.  He can stay.
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
That's right...
I really don't know what to say
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
What's this all about?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
That's crazy talk.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Not ever. Never.
I better go, Dad.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Yeah?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I mean, what do you think?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We love our lives just the way they are.
I guess.
Yeah.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
My legacy.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Very funny.
I miss them, too.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Really? You wanna write about me?
You never know around here.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
He didn't. He had it built.
He phoned it in.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Forget the store. Think big.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
I never figured you for a pimp.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You're sure?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
He was in a league of his own.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
I'm just a messenger.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I... You know... I...
Eat a power bar.
What about the blood?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Suzie Toller is missing.
Eliminate the competition.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
Where's Lombardo?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
You didn't cuff her?
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
I wanna go home now.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You are.
Nothing.
I'm not on your property!
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
That's not your line.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Put Kelly on too.
Are you mad at me?
We?
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Of course not.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
French?
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who was this partner of his?
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Let's go.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
No.  I mean yes.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
I love you.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Friend of yours?
Fresh goat's milk.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
That's all I ever wanted!
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Now use it.
Why?
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Cows. You know, cows?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Just do it!
Try the house.
Who'd you see?
...I want to say a thing.
Amish.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
You know who?
Just us.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
No.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
No, no doctor...
But why?
How long?
How long have I been here?
Buttons are Hochmut.
A real fireball.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was.
That's your way, not mine.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Not yet.
No...
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
I don't think she knows.
They don't have any shit.
You have no right here!
No... No. It is just the English way.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
If any!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Oh -- yes.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh-oh-
What sort of an animal is that?
You've had plenty of time already!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes -- that's true.
To Oz?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Leave her alone!
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Yeah --
To Oz?
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
You know something?
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh --
Oh, no!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Alright then, brunch.
Makes her look even more innocent.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The worm on the hook again.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
How long has he been with you?
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I have to go.
Really?
You, of course. I need some information.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
A rope!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Bond!
Could...could you come?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Washington?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
What's your theory?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Jon, no -- I can't --
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
What if you¹re wrong??
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
What are you up to?
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Everything's changed --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What do I get out of it?
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
We're not after car thieves here.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
We hung out last night, remember?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
What's that?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
That one I'm real familiar with.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Alright, so I'll get more.
Here we go again.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
It's too far.
Sure you are, sport.
Suit yourself.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
How?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
From your office, sir.
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Yes.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
That's a tough choice.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Yes, just the two.
I wonder what's got into them?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you hear that strange music??
Did you hear that strange music?
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
This guy means business.
Throw the third switch!
Wait till he sees the bill.
Who are you talking to?
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
No, no!  That whole thing!
That's what we're paid for.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
It's alive!
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I know Frederick.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I will.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
