No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Why?
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Well, no...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Where've you been?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
But
That's not
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
But she doesn't want to date.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He seems like he thrives on danger
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Do what?
William would never have gone to a state school.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Have you seen him?
You don't care if I die
Dorsey.
How?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
Parts of it.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
My letters of appointment.
What does he say?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
What did they say about Granada before today?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
You tell that to them!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
I will if they don't send me back.
I can't take you to my place.
Yes, I considered it.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
What are you saying?
No, what is it?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'll let you know what happens.
Of course.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Could be Leon's.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Keep them out of my way.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Where's your partner?
Where's Czech girl?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Is there a problem?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
What?
Get in the bathroom!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Did you hurt her?
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
I know.
I'm trying to tell you.
I speak English.
What was that?
Oh yeah, why?
What?
Aren't you tired?
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
That seems very unlikely.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, it is, Hal.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
How many days until you come home?
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Yeah.
I want to drive awhile.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
I hear you've got visitors.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
We eat when I say we eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Let's go.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Hey, there she is...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Yeah?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Great place for lunch.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Stall.
You want to go outside?
How much?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
So you do know her.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
And then?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
What are we going to do?
What's she doing?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Leeloo... is... she's...
I was talking to the cat.
I just found a picture of you.
I don't need one.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Hello?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Ma???
30 seconds...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Here we go again...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
How's our deal coming along?
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I love you.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
You said something about money.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
We can do that.
Where are the women?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
... sorry...
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I don't know...
I want his name.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Never mind how I found you.
Shut up.
You're making me very angry.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Who is he, his name?
He succeeded.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Hello... ?
Okay.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
It got to be too much for him.
What?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Who is this... ?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You what?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
That obvious, huh?
Been up with Alice.
Is that who you're waiting for?
Hi, beautiful.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Mark, are you okay?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Reef!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Excuse me, Skipper---
Anything ---
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
But - what can we accomplish?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You can't buy Wade off.
Guaranteed, eh?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Oh.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
In the chest.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
You know.
Break stuff?
It's not that.
Jesus, why?
Okay.
You're a policeman.
Where's the plow?
Fuck you.
On what you pay me?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Yeah.
Said what?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Coffee's perked.
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Nothing.
Sleeping.
In the living room.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
No shit.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
I don't know. You tell me.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I'm sure he's busy.
Your father never means to be so...
I don't drink coffee.
Did we warn them off?
Put your pilot on.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Why?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Jim...
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
That just doesn't make any sense.
Dunn.
Te...!
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
If that's the way you want it.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
You mean...
Are you afraid?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
What?
Captain Oveur?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
What's his problem?
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Ted...
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
He's right on the heading.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
How ya doing, honey?
Roger.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
That's right.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Let's talk Hubley.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
In the other man's rectum.
She's going to divorce me.
Why?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
No!  We must do this alone.
We can't let him get away.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Who else can I ask around here?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
You got your vest?
Position?
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Ripley...
Is she...?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Alive?
Save it.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
They cut the power.
Range twenty meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
And how are we today?
What did you say?
They're dead.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
No, it's different, honey.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Mommy...Mommy?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A brothel.
Why?
Well, what does it matter to you?
What did you think of the music?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Sir -
What is it?
Now?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Yes.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Yes!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Who was that?
Go back to bed.
What for?
What are you doing here?
Not at all.
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Upstairs.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Why not?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Majesty!
What do you mean, Sire?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
What's that?
No one calls you that.
What medicine?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Put it down!
Well, we can.
Really?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Of course not.
I'm afraid not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
What exactly are you working on?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
You mean she's not coming back?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
What?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes.
What for?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I do not seek forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
All Vienna has heard that.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
What?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Yes?
I've seen the manuscript.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
What does he want?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
How did he look?
What exactly did he call out?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Surely you're not suggesting...
The zoo? Is he rational?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
No, a cab will be faster.
David?
Yes?
I thought you were asleep.
Twenty-eight.
I know.
Hello. You all right?
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
What?
Now I'm embarrassed.
My friend Jack was just here.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yes?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Okay.
The zoo?
Don't you remember?
What?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
David, don't lose control.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
No what?
I looked.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Has he been refusing food?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
What can I say, Jack?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What's that?
No.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
He has?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?
It was more than that last week.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Well, you can. You always could.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
What's this?
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Well . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Dickson?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
Why?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Dude Finlay?
How are you fixed?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
I'm sorry, Cole.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
I think I recognize you.
What is wrong with you?
Sorry.
Yep.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Cannon or Gatling?
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
So?
Where the hell were you?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Bob's upset.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Can't argue that.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Jesse, are you awake?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Let the law --
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
You almost ended my career before it began.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I like that.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
I can't.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
This is Dorsia?
You and...Luis?
Yes?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Lucky, I guess.
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Oh really? That's great.
Late?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
I'll do it.
Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Why?
Well...
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
You're at Paul Owen s.
No.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Understandable.  Lime?
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Nothing.
What?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Marcus?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo? I'm Danny.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
It's okay. Really.
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
Gary, hi.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
Longitude 109 --
What?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Do we post it on the Net?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I don't know.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What're they building?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Or sometimes not at all.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Yes, Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
My meat and two veg.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
A limousine has just pulled up.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Who?
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
Indeed.
Austin, what's your point?
I love you, Austin.
Danger's my middle name.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Sea bass.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
He's asleep.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
We don't judge here.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
... bottle ...
... death ...
Fear ...
... love ...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
You
Promised? Who promised?
May I help you, madam ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
An unholy trinity ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
What are my choices?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Is there anything that isn't?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
What is it?
You first.
Have you any place in mind?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Makes two of us.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Oh, hello ...
How did you guess?
Weather's turning nasty.
Why?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
I feel sure of it.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
The last one you'll ever see.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Maybe it had something to do.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
1002.
But a fabulous cook.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
I can't sleep.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
I can't trust you!
I don't believe you.
Yes...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Let's go.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Really?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where'd she go?
Right in there, pal.
Who was that?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Biggest in two battalions.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
In the Field Museum once.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Yeah? What about Laura --
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I told you to stay next to me!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Really? No kidding.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Arson.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
-- Shhh.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
But he killed these guys.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
What the hell are you doing here?
Brian?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Nice boat.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Fireman shit?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
What's wrong?
And old ladies?
And the world -- the whole world.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
People.
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
How's the case going?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Yeah!
Let's go niggers!
Please.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We're ready when you are.
I'm not smiling.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
So what's up with you?
He never showed it.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You lost me.
You getting cold feet?
Which one is your brother?
Same here.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Don't make me have to use this.
You feel good, not nervous?
How's the food?
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You know how your Daddy is.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Yes you!
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
The one with da big...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
I thought you got rid of...
...I heard different, thought that was...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
I don't know who I am.
Y'know what?
And what?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
I have acted as I think fit.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
And his baggage?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Have you taken my message to him?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Who else can give me information about you?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Does this assignment interest you?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I see.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
West was one thing, but this --
Why not?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
I didn't shoot West --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
We don't need the tapes --
Do what?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
What business?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Mueller.
Why?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
But you didn't.
He admitted it.
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
Maybe --
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
You're off to a late start.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Watch me.
I didn't shoot West...
What?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
For what?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Your phone number?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Pike never confessed.
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
We know.
What is this place?
You get the eye?
Don.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Lucky girl.
Stop.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
What?
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Where are we headed?
Oh.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
How did you know my father?
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
How much time does he have left?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
What did he say?
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
No. It's not that.
You can stay tonight.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I don't want to know.
So what are you going to do?
I know you just want to punish me --
So you're just going to be vindictive
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Sometimes.
I wasn't saying anything.
I'm trying to quit.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Angela?
I need to uh...
That'd be nice.
At church?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
No, ma'am.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Better'n me?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Don't... don't say that to me...
Like a man.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
What?
I said... STOP!
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Still makin' jokes?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
Shit. Who hasn't?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What'chu sayin'?
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Please don't tell my daddy.
So...  That your first time?
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Are you wasted?
Holy shit!
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Back-up.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
I didn't know.
Nick, we can't just --
This the right place?
What'd she say?
Nick!
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
She disappeared... shit!
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
It's illegal, Nick.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
I couldn't tell.
I'm sorry.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
I need your help, Joyce.
You'll get Ich killed.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Not in that company.
One guy do all the damage?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
I want a gun.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Also extraordinary things.
Yeah.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Soon as I finish the job.
Day after tomorrow.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
Let's hear it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Jeezus!
I'd take him to the doctor.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do I make you nervous?
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Where is he?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
This feels stupid.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Bad?
Yes.
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
I don't have one.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Do you own a car?
Nope.
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
...Okay.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Name it.
Why?!
I didn't know that.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
About clothing?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
That's ridiculous.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Eve?!
Sing it to me.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Yes, it is.
What?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Gerade aus dann links!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
But, I don't understand.
That's what everybody believes?
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Right on the button.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
The recovery is very impressive.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
How old are you?
Sure.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Dad!
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Are you in trouble, son?!
We have to go.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Really?
Well, put it down and come in!
No.
You have tranquilizers?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Would you excuse me?
Should we say a little prayer first?
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
We do?
I thought ten years.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Well, what do you think?
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Um... Eve?
We did not leave together.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
Have him committed.
We came back to the house!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Anything you can tell me?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Yes.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
Hi, can I come in?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes. Frank--
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Shut up.
I'm glad you do.
Oh no.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
MOMMY!
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Frank?
Yes, but.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Can I use the car tonight?
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Yeah, I know.
Well.
Hi Dad.
Yeah, how did you know?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
He got a little jealous.
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Let's wait for some slow one.
No.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Lord's name.
Yes mother.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Hello.
Yeah, we promise.
We... met them last night.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
He got beat up by a girl.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I'm serious.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Give the guy a shot.
It is your corrupt we claim.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Of course they were. How many?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
So what are you thinkin' here?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Who the...
Chief, what the fuck is this?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Right now.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Liberating isn't it?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
What the fuck do you mean?
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
You feel?
Don't do this my son.
What do you want me to say?
The... The funny man.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
He's a nigger.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, I saw it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Loop around real fast.
Holy shit.
OK. Go ahead.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
We said 48 hours.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I'm not. But there's --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Who's in the car?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What do you think?
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Come on.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
You got to be kidding me.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Yes, he did.
Exactly. Woah.
Absolutely.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
There's a million places to hide around here.
You think he got my license plates?
Bob, where you going?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Dies y nueve.
You're Anthony?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Not even for emergencies?
So who's going to know?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Where'd she go?
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I told you they were there.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
It's registered in my mother's name.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
I can't do that, Bob.
You don't even know his name.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He said what?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he good?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
Got a little lucky.
I don't know.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Come on in!
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Save it for Bourne.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Sit down.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
You know I'm not.
I have to go now.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- car keys?
But it ends up the same.
But you're sure?
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where? -
Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I wanted to kill him.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
So when was I here?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
What's that?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
What?
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Mr. Nevins?
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Good luck.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Do we know what this says?
But... what will you do?
So let the council swear publicly.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Keep these. We're going too.
We must run in different directions!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
What is it?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
You know the answer to that.
No.
What happened?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Just. Like. Jason.
Dad lives here?
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I walk differently?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
Why's that?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I don't get it.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
So what's the point?
Smells like sex in here.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Are you sure you even packed it?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Shut up, Tommy!
Monsieur Rick?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
So you decided to go to America.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Good.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Er, good luck, yes.
Er, my check, please.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Yes?
My German's a little rusty.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Yes, of course, we --
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
And then?
And Laszlo?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Everything is quite all right.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
And I said I would never leave you.
Where is Rick?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Our faithful friend is still there.
-- Yes?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Are you ready Ilsa?
Good evening.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Yes.
No, Captain, please.
I believe you have a message for him?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
What else, my dear Major?
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
This is the end of the chase.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Huh?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
No.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
No.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Take it.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
They're on autopilot.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Jesus.
You can't make it.
You know what happened to this?
Oh?  You've tried?
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Cold.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
This isn't working out.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
Her name's Hannah.
Is that Jango?
That about sums it up.
You too.
Which I didn't have.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I was making a point.
This stinks really bad.
To Wilson.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They just want you to hire some new help.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
And that I can drive a truck!
What's she so emotional about?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Hi...
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
I don't remember.
What kind of plane are you flying?
Liberator...
Where are you going?
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
What about the trees?
So. What should I do now?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
I'm stayin', Homer.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
I don't think so.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
You're not yet three months, are you?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Who cares?
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Tough day?
So, what do you do?
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Whoa. What?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
I'm going home
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
It can buy you a new and better you.
And what about Big Al?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Minus one.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Why?
How much?
I think two million.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
Sorry, I --
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
No.  What's my cut?
What do I have to do?
And some new clothes.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
It's more than that.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Him.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
It's not history.
The King, huh? Nice going.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Did he buy it?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
Eight-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Habib?
Last hand.
And your lady?
It came my way. 450 a week.
You're shaking. What is it?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
I'm on at nine.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Gambling's not about money.
I've lived there.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
To coincidence.
There's a casino in this hotel.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I don't think we should meet again.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Who are these guys?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Five.
How?
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
Oh, God...
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Huh?
Snap out of it, bomb.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Yes, well...
Yes, Doolittle.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
What?
Commander Powell would have named it.
-- Remark.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Out there.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
I know.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Whoever that is.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
You need to get out more.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
We're quoting Mom again.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
I think you should go now.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You're crazy.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
No.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
She's got my word.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Hey, Sketchy--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
He's sick.
What about this?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Ann Arbor?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
What are you, high?
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Cool.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
They're not idiots.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
But we took the keys?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Gimme your gun, boy!
I did?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
I'm not following you.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
I want to show you something.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
What happened to your eye?
Wanna walk me home?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Why?
So, we call them... IMGs.
Will you please talk to me?
My mom is gone.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Cellar door.
Frank.
He said to follow him.
Yes.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
How are things going at school?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How many times have you seen Frank?
I know.
The good stuff.
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Because I'm so horny.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Loretta, never have kids.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Really?
I gotta work with these women.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Oh shit!
Ow!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Shut it up, Loretta.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
I'm a mirror.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
This is -- what?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
Send for my car...
About - thirty-four seconds.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What do you whistle?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
He only weighs ten ounces --
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
I can't do it...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
Once more! 
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
So that's the one you want to marry.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Well, these things take time.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Treves. Well done.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Good day...!
Tell me about it, please!
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
How awful for John.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Hello...
My name is...
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Very smart indeed.
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Ah! It's my father!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WELCOME?
WHY?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Yes -- I believe you do.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
I shouldn't have come.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
REALLY?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
But...
I... I... KILLED her...
What are YOU doing here?
There is another way.
You need to say a bit more than that!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
What are you talking about, Erik?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
She hasn't got any.
You will wait?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Aaagh!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's a tradition.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
I must only let the red rage...
There is nothing we can do...
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I did. You said, things were fine.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
In the room?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I'm so excited. Yay!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Really?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I don't really know how --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
What?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
That's scary sounding.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yeah.
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Oh, thank God. It's going.
So, um --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I'm right here.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
There's this guy!
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Come up and see me... now.
I told her today I need to end it.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
You had the whole human race pegged.
What do we do?
Okay.
I love her.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think, before.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Um, no.
What are you doing?
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
I guess so.
That's me.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
We haven't checked.
No way. I can handle this.
You better go.
I know what it is.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
It was a mutual decision.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Oh, hi.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Siwash, huh?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Whose fault was that?
What guy?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Tired...
I don't know anything about it.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
But Justin...
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Hear what?
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What's wrong?
90 over 50 and falling... .
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
This is Weir.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Can anybody hear me...
Skipper...
Peters...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
I don't know...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
I'm not the Devil.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Jesus...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain Miller, you copy?
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
I just finished drying...
Radiation interference?
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
I'm on my way, Starck.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Explosive decompression.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
You look like an eighties rock band.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Where... where am I?
No more cracks about how I look.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Not this again --
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time-out.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Are you kidding?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Something happened to them, mon.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Easy, mon.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
They're not home yet.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'm just guessing.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
I would. Yeah.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Mark. What happened to your date?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
You're losing it, Damone.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
How's it going.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Was it great?
It was okay.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Yes.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You look like you could still be in high school.
How about the point?
Are you all right?
...I've got to go home.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Naked!?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
A major!
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Las Vegas.
Hell, no!
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
Where's the medicine?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Can we make it?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Read the newspapers.
What is this?
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
I will not die because of him!
Where are you two going?
I don't think you should...
We'll be food, dickheads!
And that's how I ended up here.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
What?
Just an observation.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your parents of relation?
We gotta try.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What's it for!?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Bullshit.
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Yeah, maybe.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Let's wait it out.
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
I'm fine, I really am.
Are you lying to me?
I'm not lying.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Putting on my armor.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
'Forgive'...? For What?
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Where's Clifford?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I know you believe that.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
...So what do you think?
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
Fifteen.
Are you an actor?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
You think I'd miss it?
What happened to him?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
And?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Why do you say that?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Your big speech?
Mama...
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Say you promise.
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
I'm going out!
Excuse me.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Huh?
No!
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
And if I consent?
Soon?
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
I will not! Kill me now!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
What does it say?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I've no choice
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
What happened up there?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Ah. An explorer.
The killer is still out there.
Cabin B is ready.
Any particular reason?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
It still hurts?
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Sure.
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
You saved my life.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
It's just a dream.
Whassamatta?
You like the car?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Why are you so agitated?
He backed down.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Now, is your shit together?
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Do what?
What you said to me in the room.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Best in Mexico.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Yeah, it's mine.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
That's what I hear.
Standing right here in my office.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Then good night.
See me, sir?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Sir?  What did he say?
Shit.  Think we're had.
Did you hear?
"Coronado."
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I'll try anyway, sir.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Which is guy-speak for...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Who is it?
O'Neil?
Last time I didn't.
I think you look beautiful.
32 feet, six inches!
Wasn't deemed a threat.
This ain't workin' right!
The first female President?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He's not going to do it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
And you think this creature is one of them?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
You'd be surprised.
Did you talk with Humphries?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Merde!
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Come on, old friend...
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Shut up.
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
We heard it the first time!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
What?
Yes but, we were wondering-
What do you mean?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Go. They're off again.
What's the weather like outside?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
How do you remember this stuff?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Not a clue. You?
What?
Only answers to me.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Yes.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
But what if Sarris survives?
An interstellar vox.
Commander...
But...Why?
Excuse me?
What kind of signal?
Let's do it, Tommy.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Is that a fact.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
We've got powder but no ball!
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
What are we going to do?
Sir, I think no such thing.
To hell with Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Any word from Canada?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
I want you to see our hospital.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
A horseshoer?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Who says so?
I say!
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
So... how many movies you been in?
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
C-18.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Ray Barboni?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Sovereign.
Who the fuck are you?
He owes me money.
I'm a producer.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Have we met? I don't recall.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
That's it? That's your movie?
Once.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Really.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Personally?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Martin, look at me.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Compass.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
I got you a copy of the script.
And you think the movie business is any different?
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
I don't know.
I'm going into the movie business.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
I don't have a dog.
What money?
But you are interested?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
How about now?
What's so great about Sweden?
I don't know. Tuesday?
You think that's funny
Guess I'll just keep working.
Smokes?
What about running number two by itself?
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
I think you know.
The radio!
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's what I call a payday.
No.
What?
Go on.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Murphy to Epps.
Greer?
How's he doing?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Couldn't sleep.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Victims of what?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps? You there?
What happened?
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
I must be in the wrong business.
Yeah.
We're still drifting.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
Someone from the past.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
And what can you tell us about this... 
Who is this, Enid?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
So what do you think?
Well, yes...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Oh, hi...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
There's my dad with Joanie.
I want to do him!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
You're better at it.
What's he doing now?
We still have to go in there sometime.
It's always closed...
There he is...
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
How about this?
Where did you get that?
No way... when?
But those are our people...
Which one?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
God, you're really obsessed...
You're insane.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Why? What did he say?
Hi.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, we won't keep you.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Seymour does.
Who does?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
That tape sucked, by the way!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Hey, where are you going?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
A dollar seventy-five.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
So is that your boyfriend?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What, like a girdle?
Wow!  What was that all about?
What? You're kidding me...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
Just someone so young...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why? What did she tell you?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
What are you talking about?
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Very good indeed.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
What a good week.
But of course yours worked.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Afraid of lions.
How many cattle?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Does he ever mention me?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Certainly.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I'll do it.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Oh, hello, Peter.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Maybe I should call Janine.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I know.
Then why have you come?
Yes, the scourge --
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
Egon!
So far so good.
Pretty impressive, huh?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I'm ready.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Does it have any favorites?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
All right.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
I don't believe in luck.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Are you Peter Venkman?
You could say that.
And may I see this storage facility?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yes?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Gozer.
I've got to sleep.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
I told you it's real.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Agile bastard, isn't he?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
That's what you told me two days ago!
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Gladly Caesar.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Caesar?
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Give away food?
Marcus Aurelius has died.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Would that Marcus had lived.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
So I understand.
The Senators admire you.
My troops don't make policy.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
They're studying with Cynics.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Yes.
What?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But you might.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Ben!
Ben.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
You a student?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
I want you out of here.
Could you bring it up?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
Where are you?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Where is it?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
No.
What?
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Where is it?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Why don't you get it.
Yes?
To tell you?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
What?
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Oh.
No.
Can I take off my clothes now?
There isn't any.
Thank you.
We don't.
No.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Yes.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well, I'm not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
This is absurd.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Sir?
When I go off?
I drive around.
They don't know?
-- worried?
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Yes?
Is anything wrong?
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Who?
Reducing?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Free --
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
You live here?
For tonight. 
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Yes -- I do understand.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
You are beautiful!
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
That's a silly joke.
I don't want them now.
Very early in the morning.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
The Baron is tired?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
You've lost everything?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
I thought she was splendid!
It's always so quiet here.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Is that for me?
For me?
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, Doctor.
Any letters?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Money!
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Tired?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What?
What brown hands you have.
Can't you understand me?
Cotton Company --
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Miss Flaemm.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Why not?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
All right.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Good morning, Pimenov.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
No news yet?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You're calling the shots.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Perk, remember?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Myra followed you, huh?
Just a few bucks.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Every day in every way.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
What?  What for?
You -- I don't know.
She didn't see you, in other words.
That's what I say.
Oh, Jesus.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Carter.
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Now you're joking, right?
Why didn't you tell me?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Looks great.  It does.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Look, they're staring right at us.
Can't you hold it?
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Shit, Linda!
Let the party begin.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Answer what?
He says things.  Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
God ... this can't be true.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
God, what's wrong with him?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
Yes?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
We've never met.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
I suppose.
Oh, shit.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
When?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
In what way, pray tell?
What?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
You're my buddy.
Out!
You were about to ask a question?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
What kind of exercise?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm engaged.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Your old beau?
We all are.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
What a honeymoon.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
No.
Such as?...
Tell me about its sexual roots.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
No you're not!
Why not?
I came for my clothes.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Blue soup?
He's a child!
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
No you don't.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I've literally got to run!
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
What is this thing that kills me?
New lives begin!
I dunno, boy.
It was a bitch.
Alice got married again.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
I'm only ten years old.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
Something's made you sore.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Don't touch me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
Stay home tonight!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Not true.
Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Who have you been talking to?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
I'm glad.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
The park!
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
Take plenty of cigars.
We made the date three months ago.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
It is?
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
What kind of a life is that?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
I'm amazed.
He's not your son.
Get out of here.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I just want to ask some questions.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
Yeah.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Sam?
Yeah.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Where's he?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
A friend.
Jesus.
She's dead.
Not very.
What do you care about?
Tijuana.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
You really believe all that?
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
But what?
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
Mast?
Where is she?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
I don't know.
Yeah, sure.
Where'd you hear that name?
Does she know anything about this?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What plan?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
That's all right.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Okay, lady. Out.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Wait here.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you see?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
But this is my car.
Yes. Very much.
You don't look eighty.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
What was that?
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
What is it, Harold?
Don't you advance on me.
Oh, Harold. 
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
What would you say?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Jeez! That's a great story,
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
I... I had a visitor.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Nonsense, I...
Is he serious??
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Who wards off demons.
Reliquary --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
I worry about you.
Don't look! Turn around.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Got tired of me?
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Don't move. We --
Helping you -- I just --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Are you sure about this?
He's just pushy.
Cocky.
Hit me.
It's my lucky day.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Who are you?
This isn't for real.
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well can I come in or not?
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
This is what began it.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Which is where?
You're still blaming me.
Where are you?
How are you doing through there?
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you all right?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
-- I'll go see.
Please...
What are you talking about?
What are you drinking?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Who brought me in here?
Where are you?
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Surprise.
I love you, honey.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Really?
I have to talk to you.
What's the problem?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
What did he ever do to you?
What do you mean, "what?"
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
How do you know about that?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
What's up?
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Well what about the new Echo --
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna Moss.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Nice friend.
Hey Rob.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
It's Vince and Justin.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
I don't know.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Nevermind.
Is it better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Hello.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You still together?  Going all right?
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I can't talk right now.
Pig died.
Do you want me to be there?
Look, are you coming or not?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Hey.  It's Liz.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Yeah.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Yeah?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Sixty.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Yeah.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Byzantine?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Probably.
I've been to Church Hill.
Where?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
Yes.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
You're an asshole, Moran.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
It's that important?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Be quiet.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
I did at that.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Yes.  Always.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Impotent cow.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
But why be so concerned about me?
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
Who?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We need more time.
You seem to understand a great deal.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Are you sure?
Head still secure to the neck.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
You're insane.
You've been here from the start.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
But --
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
No -- she didn't.
Mother? But your mother --
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Well, I'm independent, too.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Hildy!
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
Get out!
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Keep away --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
I'm not working for any other paper!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
What now?
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
I know, but --
Hildy!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Then why are you doing it?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Hildy, darling!
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
How much?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I call. What you got?
Hey!
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
We'll fix that, too. 
And so do I!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
That man there!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Hey --
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
No, I don't think so.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Is it hard?
Here's the picture of my wife.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
I know a secret.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You want to join our gang?
Ask her yourself.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
It's like telling fibs.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
What is it?
Why not?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
Has Sue got it right?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Out.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Up to six weeks, I think.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
We did the decent thing.
What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
No, really.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
She looks like she stinks.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Quiet.
I gotta open the gate.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Don't even say it.
You got to be fucking joking.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Huh?
Oh, right.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Well hello, officer.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Fit the profile?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Tell it to my daughter.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
Wydell.
Tell him, Harold.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Is everything fine?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I am sleepy.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
My little French.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Urgh.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Anyway. Come already to the point.
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Progress!
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
As do I.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Boy, this is good!
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Fifteen.
Yes, darling.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.
That's very funny.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
What are you doing in there?
I'm just preoccupied.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
You were gone a long time.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Oh boy!
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Make it twenty.
You being cute?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
To do what?
Seventy-five per cent.
You think I can lose?
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Where do I sign?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
What's that supposed to mean?
So does Eddie.
'Bout even.
Well, here it's half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
You name it, we shoot it.
The expensive kind.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
With what?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Would you like to come out tonight?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Who's he?
What's the limit?
Okay, friend. You're on.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
What do you do on the other days?
Do you want me to go?
What's this supposed to mean?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Is that a fact?
Yeah. That's right, too.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Yes.
What about... now?
Yes.
What do you want?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
You built things.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I left it at work.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
What do you want?
Connie, don't hang up.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Spunky. He told you about that?
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
You still got the Olds?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
Not listed, huh?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Sorry for what?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
We should leave too.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
What?
Tapestries?
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
My room!
No?
What do you know about this place?
This one. I think he's in here.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Right.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
How did you she was a Nazi?
What am I looking for?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
I ought to tell you something.
Head for the fireplace!
Booby traps?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Dad, are we hit?!
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
No.
All right! Where's my father
Just a routine inspection tour.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Siam.
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
What'd he say?
It's pulling me deeper!
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Primitive sexual practices?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
You're not gonna believe this...
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Al.
Yes.
What is your name?
Do me a favor, Al.
Why he's argumentative?
I'll talk to them.
It can't take that long.
They could put you back in the tube..
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Black suits and helmets.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
What is it?
What about it?
I don't have any.
They'll know who I am.
The beach.
Do you notice anything.
Why not?
It's sand.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
What?
I made it work.
You really like that shirt?
Which one is she?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
They're all in it.
Even Rene?
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
I can't...
Well...?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I have been... I think you're right.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
Nice?
In him?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
It's just money.
He's not an ordinary man.
And how do you service foreigners.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Sue who?
I noticed you staring.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Dinner...tonight.
You again.
Can I help?
Promise you what?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Who do you work for?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Were you working for him last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
You know where he went?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Hiroshima.
We figure out if it's in here.
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
What?
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
This going to work?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
He told me what to do.
What is it?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
This the only spare?
It'l be alright.
What does he know?
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
What's that outside, Daddy?
I heard them.
What? Forget it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Alright, alright.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Do you want more rice?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
How are you, Jim?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
No, you do not.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.
Hardly new news.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Next to your father?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Good. But Jeff...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What's happening?!
Where you staying now?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
You did good, Massey!
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Got any symptoms?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
I begged you to have a baby!
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She held that against you?
Your mother was.
Friends?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Huh?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I know.
But?
Hi.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
You were going to have this thug...?
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Hello, Rex.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
He was right, wasn't he?
Do you know him?
Maybe.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Mr. Massey --
My client has ruled that out.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
She always looked out for me.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Video.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What are they?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Who's "Patty."
Oh—Mary—
Yes, sir?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
You're a peculiar chap.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Why don't you put me in chains?
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Nothing. 
On the road.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
If you really mean it, I will.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
What am I going to do now?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Here—
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Where is the shower?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
King—King Westley was in it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Next week "East Lynne."
I refuse to resign!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
No.
What's the matter?
Sure.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Raw?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Better go back to your bed.
You're forgetting you're married.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
What's up?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Yeah, where am I?
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What's on your mind?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Did he pay?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
No, I did not.
It leads farther than that.
...give me protection?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
I see.  And where did you drive?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
What about Ruby?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
A Perry Russo?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
What are you driving at, boss?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
His name?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Virginia.
What are they?
Can I help you?
I'll call her.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I need a favor.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
You don't want much, do you?
Can I see your I.D.?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
What did they want to know?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
How many trips did you make?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Who is this?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Why?
My ass ain't the same.
What'd ya see?
Does it happen to all men?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
How old's Annette?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
Then you're out and you get nothing.
In a dress.
We're partners.
Where're you going?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
I know what it looks like.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
Ever been tempted?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
But you didn't do that.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
What about you?
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
You think I'm kidding?
Got some o.j.?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Yeah.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
It's true, isn't it?
Yeah, I think a woman.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Managers get ten percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
What'd you care?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Want a hit?
Were you a disco guy?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Guess where I am?
Sure.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Uh-huh.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Maybe the Feds got it.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You gonna tell me who it was?
How am I supposed to know that?
Yeah.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Beaumont Livingston.
Haven't a clue.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
How'd you find me?
Call her, tell her the combination.
She's all alone.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Dream on!
Della?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
It's short, huh?
That's right. We did.
Tell your mother.
Wait ... Daddy.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think they're connected?
What can I tell you?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I can't relax.
I had this weird flash just then.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
What? By myself?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I don't want to know.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
I moved the couch. That's all.
The room!
I don't know.
Thanks.  What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Why you left.
Ready?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
We're at Della's.
Where?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Coming here?
I can't do it.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
How come? The army?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
How?
Please.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Why won't you answer me?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You look upset.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Long time ago.
You come here often?
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
No. I couldn't.
For what? For seeking the truth?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Clear the area. This is an order!
He'll never make it.
Where am I?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Speaking.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Nope.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
You come home with me.
Do you want me to get someone?
He doesn't like it.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
What?
Everyone okay?
Hey! I'm not ready.
How many?
Where is...?
Then what do we do?!
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Jesus, God!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
I think I had some when I was eight.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Push off toward us.
And what's with the headgear?
This is what it means right here.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
No.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I didn't say I was good at it.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Kicker!
I don't understand...what does he want?
I'm sending you the files.
Nanotechnology.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
What's that one, there?
What about us?
Be careful.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Why?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Why don't we just tow it in?
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
You're leaving?
Is that a boat?
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You know how I feel about her.
I don't know...
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
You're being really immature.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
I try really hard, actually...
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Wow, dream big!
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
What?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
What...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Who is the kid?
Excuse me?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I sort of already have.
What?!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Aw, please Junebug?
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
You guys are playing music?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Have you found a place to stay?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
...Yeah.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Hold still.
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
What's your name, boy?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
If you say so.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Fuck!
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Not yet.
Bri'.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Umm. Altogether?
With how many people?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Yeah.
Are you hungry?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
It is right.
You thirsty?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Can you do it man?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Right.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
Why not? You stink.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
She won't? Why not?
Uh huh.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Do you care about me?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Telly is at Steven's?
What?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yep.
It's like...
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
You think so?
He still does.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Right.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
What man? What is it?
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
What kind of problem?
Casual.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You got it on the board.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Yes you are.
The message!  I figured out--
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
Why does he call Sanderson?
Who is this?
What makes you think I was there?
Hello.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
It's me you want.  Not her.
You might not have done it had you known.
Come here.
Do you like my dad?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Who told you that?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Yeah.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Through a rental agency.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
Did you send the car?
You're always in the middle of a match.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
They couldn't break the riddle.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
I know it was bad.
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
I thought you said the line was busy?
Nothing.
Peter, you have to admit--
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You're going to be late for your match.
You beat him.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
They have Lyssa!
The new Queen lives.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
But you suspect.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
The spiral begins in the west.
You're coming with us.
Each to his fate.
Even by you?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
How did you know I had sons?
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
And where do you lead, boy?
You've eaten nothing.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
What is that awful looking place?
A small house.
My heart stays here.
You do?
I'm hungry.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is important to assure the succession.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
The new King.
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Each to his fate, lad.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
We had no children.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
How can you say it?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
May I go to the cinema?
Why?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
A little...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
Yes?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...OK... Good.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Maybe later.
Pardon?
The new store?
What it is -- is the truth.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You're talking to me?
No.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
He's plastered.
I don't know.
I know where my heaven is.
From where?
Most certainly.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Tom Joad?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Where did he go?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
This is the home of an angel.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Will you lighten up, please?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Where have you been?
I can't tell you.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Why would I kill my husband?
Go to hell.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
How many, would you say?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Yes?
What'd you do?
No.
God, that felt great!
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
I'm a bitch.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Too demure?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
I can't.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Are you asking me on a date?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
I completely agree.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Harvard. Law school.
Are you serious?
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Three months.
She's naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Why do you say that?
Elle?
Fool's magic.
More fun win battle?
My generosity is not so large as that.
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
But I'm hideous!
Protection?
To be my bride, of course.
And then?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
No, wait... please... listen...
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Enough!
And if I cannot?
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
This is ogre's magic.
Blackheart?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Can we trust him?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
I don't... understand.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Will you explain what's going on?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll try.
You promised!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
A gentleman would offer water.
I detest serpents.
What's the matter?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Its powers are strong.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Sunlight?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Not very precise directions.
This is sad news, be it true.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Wondrously so.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Please...
What do we do now?
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
What are you doing?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I wanna be with you today.
Oh.
And why was the alarm on?
Why?  What do you mean?
Atonement.
My keys.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
My mother would die.
Hey.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Huh?
Why are you so uptight?
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I hate to ask about a window.
Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Maybe that's too long.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
For everything.
I'm sorry.
I did warn you.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I hate turkey.
You can't make me do a thing.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Left you this place.
Ah!  Oh....
Oh.  Sorry.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Money?
Where will you live?
When's school over?
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
George --
What have you been before today?
Oh...with his ear infection!
With your hands or your tongue?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
You've never said that before.
Is your back still killing you?
He said he heard hammering.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
What are you doing home?
You're sure about this?
You could keep it and rent it out?
What did you say?
Adam, that's not true!
Nagger?
A night in the hole?
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
She's alright, isn't she?
Take care of me?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Engagement ring!
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
That's because I've never been here before.
I don't think so.
What?
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
I said you're soft.
Yeah, I want some pie.
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Does that mean I'm in?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Let it go, Claude.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
That was five years ago.
I'm not working on a plan.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Just like Elvis.
They gave me life, mama.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Something like that, yes.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Where'd you get this?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
You shouldn't have come here.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
She goes to Parson's, right?
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
An angel?
How did you see me?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Hey.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
By she, do you mean he?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Valerie?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Off limits.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
How did they get in here?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
You prefer women?
Sad? What made you sad?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I thought I had to do something.
Not about that.
I'm listening.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
K.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
It's different now. Help me.
I don't have much time.
What're you going to do?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You know, Jessica.
To what?
All this. All of it.
I'll make the arrangements.
How long have you been living here?
I have always been here...
Gracious... no.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Not yet.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Can you make it back?
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
You okay, man?
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Hello.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you my man?
Yes.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Yeah.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
No.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
Same one you were reading the other night?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I told you to stay in the car!
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
You like pornos?
How ya doin', Pete?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Okay.
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Sheila?!
Where'd you come from?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Okay, brother.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
No kidding?
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
They were in a quandary, and—
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Chalmers Bryant!
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Hey - look!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Oh, yes.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Well, it must have taken–
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
You're startled?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Yes.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Oh, stop it!
What's it mean?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What about the others?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
My name's Sondra.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
What is it?
EXCUSE ME–
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
The hell were you thinking?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
It's a bug.
So what's the problem?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
What's going on, Kay?
You think that's what's-happening?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
What is it?
Goodwill...
How's Dee?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went right to the President.
Actually, I don't know...
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
What?
What?
Drop some money.
Please, I want to go back...
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Who wanted her little girl back?
You set your patients on fire!
I can't even stand up --
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Lara --
I'm fine.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You can't run --
John --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Seventeen minutes.
You're kidding, that's today?
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
We can't grab it...
The mall?
Yeah?  So?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Confirm with trig and image.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Just a nickname.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
You gonna tell on me?
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Wally, listen to me...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Just go to the beginning!
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
They don't belong to anybody.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
Sean, wait...
Some -- somebody's father?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Kill me!
You're not gonna kill me...
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Good God.  What was that?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
What?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
How many?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Howard --
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
You're Bobby, right?
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Not on me, sir.
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Holy shit.
He's okay.
We used to take baths together.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Bullshit.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
No.
I don't know.
Honey?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
There's no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Your dance is over.
Get away from her.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
That it?
Why?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Ruiz knows about this?
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
No. Just the cross streets.
Understand me?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Ask if he said anything to her.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
I think we might.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Bullshit...
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I gotta pick up the baby.
It's not even yours.
How'd you unlock my phone?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Who's driving her?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I'll get the girl.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Back in.
What are you doing.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
I'm pretty sure we do.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Excuse me.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
See you later.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
A lot of Persians?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
We're square.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
How's it feel?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
You're a damn liar.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
What?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I know.
The talk is everywhere!
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Let's cancel.
You put it very well.
Did you see the papers today?
Say what you're saying.
You know that gal?
I ain't stupid.
Murder.
Another one?
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
Me?
You're too small to be Bogart.
So what about him?
I'm the man.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Are you sure?
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
So where do we begin?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Si.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[What do you mean?]
[Lucky how?]
[And?]
[The ransom was ten.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
What is it?
Is it loaded?
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So what's wrong?
Yeah, right...
How long you staying, Crease?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Pinta...
Yes or no?
No.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Time will tell.
No.
Could I stop you?
You think too much?
Dyslexic?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Last night. Do you know something?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You helped him get this job.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Oh, yeah.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I could see she likes you.
I'll call her up.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
It must be one o'clock.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Your son Marty?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
This is the kitchen.
I'll wait for your call.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya, Ralph...
What nurses?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
He coming home right now.
Sure.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Wadda you so sore about?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Home.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
What?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Any time. Whenever we want.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Wait a second...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
And there it is.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Radar!
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
See you.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
You're an attractive man.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Yes, Reverend?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Nice.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Are you all right?
You got me.
Me?
Oh.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
What?
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
What letter?
Who, for instance?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
I got it all ready. Here.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Help yourself.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
It must be some kind of a gag.
A what?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
I want it as soon as possible.
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How about family? Got any family?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Is there anything wrong?
What difference does that make?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
She isn't?
Oh!
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Tell my dad.
Where's the car?
Who are you again?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
National Marksman Competition.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Yes.
To save lives.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
To run last?
How much you wanna bet?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
So what do you want to do?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Mmm, needs a little something.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I'll provide you with transportation.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
What have you promised them?
How come I can't remember?
Why --
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Where the hell are you going?
But what if he doesn't --
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
A hotel?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Why would I do that?
But you were with me.
Sorry?!
This.  No point to it.
Because you'll never believe me.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Activated.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --

Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
But boss, what about their parents?
What!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
But I've never served a day.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Charlie Luciano.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Up here, Boss.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
No. They envy you.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
You boys carryin' pieces?
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
We learn from life.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
They do what I tell 'em.
Forget it. That's past.
Masseria's been after me too.
Strategy.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Uhh - martini?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're acting kind of...odd.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
The ring...
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Where to?
... Oh ...
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
What's this, Diz?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Drunks are funny--
Good idea. When?
Tunnel?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No.
No--not offhand--
He's a house-afire!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
I yield.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Will he yield for a question?
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Please, sir!--come with me!
No, Jeff--please--!
Oh, now--
*No*!
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
He did?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Go right ahead.
Abigail.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Oh--Saunders--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Order, gentlemen!
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Do you?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Just a minute, Joe!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Yes.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Are you married?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Uh-huh.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that—
He played in the town band, too.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
In a day or so, I think.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
People have been crucified before.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
With pay!
Did it?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Boy, was he burning.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Miss Bennett please!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Mr. Cedar!
Newspaperman?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Look!
Yes?
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
How do you do.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
That's funny. Why is that?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Entertainment?
Arthur wants to quit!
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
I write poetry.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Why are they ganging up against me?
How did they threaten you?
You can go out there if you like...
Mr. Cook.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Thank you.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
What brought this on?
Oh?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
What it might take is... doing time.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Don't need it.
How are you?
Finally, some common sense...
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What can you tell me about this?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
What would you do?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Which thing?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
But...
You got off easy.
Weekly or monthly?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
What'd he say?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Nah... scotch.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out...
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
C'mon, friend.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What just happened?
Yeah?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
You bastards!
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
A bright good morning to all.
I just decked your brother
Yeah, I was there.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
You...! YOU...!
Yes?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
I found it, Evy! I found it
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
We didn't think this through very well.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
They always call the great ones nuts.
Are you with me... or against me?
And the light goes out...
Who's the artist?
I'd better go.
What?
Who?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Roy.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's me.
There's a big difference.
But there's still only six of us.
So what else has Superman got?
Are you coming or not?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
What do you have in mind?
Any cannon?
Properly arranged, yes.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Who is there?
Yes, sir, I am.
Thank you, sir.
No, they're living in Nice now.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Four o'clock.
When did it start?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
What is that?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Would you like some brandy?
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Do you expect me to believe that?
One had better legs.
Promise me.
Promise.
What are you doing in there?
Separate bedrooms?
Yes.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
What the hell is the matter with you?
I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
How do you know?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
We have a treaty with Austria.
And where do you place Alexander?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
That's it?
Alright, I'll remember that.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Yes you did.
Great moves, Day-Day.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
No.
You're welcome, Unc.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Nice to meet you?
What is it?
That the big one, huh?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
What?!  What that mean?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Call me.
I got fired too.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Where did Craig move to?
William.
What?
Hey, how you get out of here.
What about that ugly dog?
Huh?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I remember you...in the elevator.
How do you know that?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Good luck.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
No way.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Keep your eyes peeled.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Only you.
Put her on.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Where's your Mom?
You understand?
O, she's all right.
No.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Is he hit pretty bad?
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Hing, hang, hung.
John...
To see Dad?
Why?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
All right boy: where's the money?
What?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
What secret shall I tell?
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
All right.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Pearl and John.
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Mornin', ladies.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
She took them kids with her?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
How can you tell?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
What the hell's going on!?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
My dream.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Hello Nancy.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
What the hell you doing here?
What is it, Ninotchka?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
A dress you wear in the evening.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What a lovely room you have here.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Comrade Buljanoff...
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Have you?
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Yes, General Savitzky?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
A week?
A cow?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Yes, Comrade.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
What business?
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
How long does it take a man to land?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Is this what you call the "butler"?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
It's twelve o'clock.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I wish they had never met.
Not funny, huh?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Did you make any change in this room?
Ninotchka, I love you.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Shhh! Shhh!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Are we going to build our little house?
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
...and we won't clench our fist...
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Radio! What is radio?
But I can throw it out of the window.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
They belong to the people.
Hello, Leon!
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
All right, I'll listen.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
She's gone, Leon.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Good morning, Comrade.
May I ask why?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Son of a bitch.
Executive clemency ...
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
To protect his people.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Yeah?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Where's Hunt now?
And?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
This is not a joke, John!
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Sorry ...
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
That's what they're doing.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
So?
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
All right.
Just do what I say, Bob.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Sir?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
What about the documents he promised?
What'd he say?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
What?
Yes.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
That'll be the day.
Jesus Christ!
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Sir?
That's right.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Of them.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Is that the truth?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
This.  Above all.
Yes!
You personally?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
You ain't heard from him?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
That's the boy.
We goin' in?
What was the bullet?
Yes sir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
You gonna drive out there?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Don't get hurt.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.
You gave your word?
It's full a money.
What'd you give for that thing?
So... for how long do we have to...
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I know something better.
Yessir?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Mm-hm.
...You need to talk to me.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
This. And the gas.
See about closing.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
You married into it.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You on all night?
How well do you know Chigurh.
...But that won't last.
Not that way.
...What do you do?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Yes sir.
Are you in the service?
Sheriff, I don't...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
The LeSabre!
Are you and Larry happy?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Lyla's very nice.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
What happened when you were twelve?
Of course.
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Uh-huh.
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
That's horrible!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?
Who?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
No...
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
I know that.
Worse... you're in Texas.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
We should go.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Where? Where is she?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Is there a problem, George?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Huh?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Them straw polls is ugly.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Devil his due.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Where's your ring, honey?
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Uh-huh.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
That don't make no sense!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
She's at the five and dime.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Who gave you this idea?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Yes, sir!!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Vietnam?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Great.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Not me.
He didn't give you much choice.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You're better than candy.
I don't want you to move.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
What would you do differently?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I can't risk it.
He said he grew up poor?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
No problem, but who's Susan?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
God.
The fuck did you do that for?!
I have the gun.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Get the fuck away from me.
Keep your voice down.
Shut up.
Open it.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Oh, I've seen these...
We're leaving.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Open the door.
Fuck.
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
No.
I'm sorry.
Huh uh.
What if I keep dropping?
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
I don't know. Look around man.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
So what's the deal?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Yeah.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
No.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
How did this... how did I let this happen?
I said, I'm not my sister.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
We did.
Apology accepted.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Oh?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
What?
And what do they know?
Please.
You were an Englishman then...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
When?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
How many came back?
But father, they might come this way.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Well...I guess not.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Please hurry.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Ellie? What's wrong?
What's up, sugar?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
You folks ready to go on?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
I guess so...but...
You want to rest a bit before you start?
What are those for?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Rachel not feeling well?
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Gage's gone!
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Louis, are you sure?
How does he do that?
What's in your head, boy?
We got that part.  Anything else?
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Do you not know what this is, then?
Man overboard!
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
What?
If I had known --
Me!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
No.  She hasn't.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
A moment.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Pollution?
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
... plastic.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
Poppy, please --
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Where did he go?
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Yeah?  So what?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
The big house.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Yeah.
You don't know?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
That's right.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Do you have something to bring me down?
You made this out of my hair?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
What in the...?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
We were different people then.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Vermin...
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Anne, come here. Listen—
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
Ah-ah-ah!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Yale '21, I believe.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Why not?
Well, when are you quitting?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
No?
Who are you?
Oh no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Well!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?
Conrad.
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
What could I be?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
With pleasure, Madame!
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
But I—
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
No, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Yes sir.
Yes.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
I won't.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh, George ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
... Why?
No. What?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
What happened?
Well--it was dark out ...
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
He won't notice anyway.
Me too. Sounds swell.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Sure ... Where would we go?
How?
You want some berries?
They just grow like that?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Right. And how did she dress him?
What department store did they go to?
Ooomph?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Oh--well ...
Look ...
OW!
How long do you think you've been here?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
...yes I'm still on hold...
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Well I don't want to do something like that.
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Are you gonna do it?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
You're so scared.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Hi, is this Jack?
It doesn't matter.
Where is she?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Me?
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Hello?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Really?
You like her?
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yes.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out very often.
Yeah?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
That's right you travel so much.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your Social Security number.
337.....I'm sorry....
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Sorry about that.
How many sisters do you have?
Like a psychiatrist?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
WHICH?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Where you been?
I need to talk to you for a second.
What is this, man?
Are you serious with this?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I know.
I know.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
He did seem a little strange.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Madeleine --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
By whom? The Marquis?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
It's not even noon --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
You always do.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
What on earth would that require?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
As for the author... shoot him.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
A kiss for each page.
It's a long story, this one.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
I am not a wealthy woman.
What thought is that?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The actor
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
So I've been told.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Why is that, Louis?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
Then you explain it to me?!
I will not defend my life to you--
There is nothing to discuss-
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You needn't use that language with me
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You are repellant when you drink.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
No -- no -- I mean--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Not for me.
Right-
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Yes.
I expected more from you.
It doesn't have to be
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You're going to destroy it
You talked to New York?
Get out
Jesus
Then find another theater
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
It's just that my movie is so-
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Where's your wife, Jake?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Answer me when I talk to you.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What did Tommy say?
See? That's all there was to it.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
When?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
What?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
You sound bitter.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
I like the gym smell.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
No, I'm not.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Yeah.
Huh?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
OK. Talk.
Then what?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
This is the baby sitter.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
Who said they left then?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Where?
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I'll send you some comic books.
It's me.
Can you get me that ring back?
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
She expects me to marry her.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's only perfect.
You're never going to marry?
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
I was.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
There's probably one in the basement.
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
And you love life?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Something big going on somewhere?
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
How can you tell that -- from here?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
I wonder where he's going now?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
That's a suitcase?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Wasn't that close?
How?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Feel okay?
Yeah!
That's funny!
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Go ahead.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Have some cigars.
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Are you going down there?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Hi.
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
What?
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
When was that?
Why?
Plato!
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No.
Leave me alone.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Won't mother be proud.
The kids take me.
No--I was just--maybe--
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Oh, Jim!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You disappointed?
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Yeah.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
We could live it up and --
NO!
Nick, no --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
That guy knows you?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
What?
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I shared his cell!
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Might as well be.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
No way.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Where the HELL did he go?
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Haven't thought about it.
Ain't there yet.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
GUARD!!!
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
That was my king!
Alone at last.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Yeah.
What about?
What's this?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Wong?
What's that?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Nope.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Follow you where?
Why?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't believe in it.
I'm cool.
Want a smoke?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do you think?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
He ain't dead.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Why!
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Maybe he did.
It doesn't matter who they are.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Goodbye, Mary.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
I don't care what she asked you.
How's that?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Where is he?
What for?
Put on another one.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Aren't we stayin'?
That's the end of the line.
And you've got me all figured out?
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
It's coming!
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Shhh... It's okay.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Hi Buddy.
It looks like the furnace.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Listen to me I --
Oh.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop! --
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
I'm sorry.
Huh?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Let me see the files.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
In about fifteen minutes.
My God! Is she dead?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Hello Dwight.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
I'm so glad you're here.
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Hi, Mom.
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
That's nice.
No woman would!
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Don't wake the kids...
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
I beg your pardon?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
You got your wish.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs... Sutphin?
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
What was that?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
You could go and open the door.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
No.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
Hello, Frances.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Weren't you afraid?
But you do believe me?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Do you think he knows about this?
No!
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
I have been at the library.
But you're always at the library.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I'm at sea, Jason.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
I understand.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Uh—huh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Dr. Judd?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
It seems right to us.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I was a great dancer...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Oh, uh-huh.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I feel like they do.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Are you in the middle of something?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Videotapes.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Yes.
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
I have money.
Yes, I have. I will.
So you do fantasize?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Why not?
How come?
I can't.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Don't do that.
I want to touch you.
Yes. I just got busy.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
I have thought about it, yes.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Is he still at your house?
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
So what's my share of the dress?
Do you have my work number?
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
Do I know you?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
And that's all?
And you ask questions, right?
Do I sit or stand?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Okay.
No? Not even one more?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Could be risky.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Maybe.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Right now.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
I wish you hadn't done that.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Plenty of room for two people.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
What happened?
Who was she?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
We're the experts.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
That's us.
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Poor Brad.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
WHAT A JOKE...
THAT MINIMAL
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
I love you.
Miles.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
What are you pouring tonight?
How's it hanging, Miles?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
That's your problem, Miles.
You still seeing that shrink?
And Lexapro, yes.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
When do we get to drink it?
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
So what's the plan today?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Well, she is cute.
Shut up. Shut your face.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
That was three years ago after that first party!
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Is it the money thing?
What?
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
She tell you she was married?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Yep. Quite a day.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
See you, Miles. You take care.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I'm here.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
Do you think it's a possibility?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're on the roof.
This is going to do nothing.
How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Have they said anything about our area?
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
Yes.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
It's the strangest thing Father.
What's that?
What was the first thing?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Don't do it!
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Sounds good.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
This is a brutal land.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I already did that.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Women?
No hard feelings.
Who?
That's a lie.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
You wanted to see me?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
He was murdered.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
What is it you want from me?
I'm going to have to look into this.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Nifty.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
I am telling the truth.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I'm glad we talked.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
The public decides who's on that list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
The picture's dead.
Why isn't she with you?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
What about it?
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
Really?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
So you did meet her?
Of course.
Do what you do to Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
There's... a wall between you --
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
"Straw God" changed my life.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Not quite how I imagined it --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
This is the story.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Abduction?
Don't you?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
What if it catches on fire?
You mean they buy it?
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I forgot your name.
You use needles?
I'm going to see you again, right?
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Where should I look then, Cole?
He hates me.
What?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, I am.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
What are you thinking, Momma?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
I don't know how else to look--
What--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
It's our pleasure.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Nope.
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
I could. You sucked.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
"With a hack-hack here --"
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Amends...?
Who? Us?!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Suzie... No.
No --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Mac... let's get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Where's Mac?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
What are you doing?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Looks like a chipmunk.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
I'll get if for you.
You.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Well?...
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
Driving, talking to me...
Guess what?
I give up.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Jesus!!!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
How do you know?
See ya, Bandit.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
See.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
You know how to drive one of these things?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
What's your twenty?
I ran into complications.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Breaker. Breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Have any trouble getting here?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Of course. Yes.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
He's giving them up?
Mortal.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
But there were more of you?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
Your attitude sucks.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
I left him a message.
I am. Yeah.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...When did you know all this?
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
I wouldn't go that far.
Yeah... Sid?
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
I'm working on it.
You love her?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
What?
I DON'T KNOW!
You'll end up like me.
Yes.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Who was it?
How much sleep do you need?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
I wish you'd told me.
Get out --
What plan?
Yes.
Don't.
To calm your anxiety.
Book?
Rheya.  Not here.
You still don't believe in God?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What's wrong.
Was she right?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Gibarian.  He was here.
I want you here.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
I think they help.
Where did you go before?
How can you be here...
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's terrific Win.
Right.  That's true.
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I'll come with you.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.
No dog.
No dog.
But "nice".
What do you want?
Let go!
Not exactly.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Are you okay?
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
... Mike.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm sorry.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
I just sat and listened.
What about when she goes out?
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Not Koontz.
No, sir...
Why should she come in?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Okay, I guess.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Sexual tension...
Flash, drop it--
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Mr. Jameson--
Would you cool it already?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
He knew.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
Do you mind if I come too?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
I will finish what I've begun…
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
How much do you know about it?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Where'd you get the clown suit?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Come on!
Ready?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You won't get off that cheap.
You are being rude again.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Jawohl?
What is this? This is water?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
You want Betty Grable!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What's the award?
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You starting that again?
How do they know?
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Are you questioning me?
Ach so!
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Ich weiss alles.
Good morning, Sefton.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Have a nice time over there?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
What?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
No, no. Thank you.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Better?
Antonia?
Yes.  Thank you.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
A photon torpedo?
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
You want me to contact Starfleet?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Status!
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
David, I don't understand...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Good shooting, Scotty.
Just him, sir!
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Genesis, I want it.
I -- saw no future --
Yes...
... Or the one.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
You amaze me, Commander.
Physician, heal thyself.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
And who am I hiding from?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Wait --
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Is that a poem?
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Maybe...
Don't tell me you've got something.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
What?
I don't mean to intrude.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Inoperative.
Time's up, Admiral...
Aye, sir.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
A distinct possibility.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Khan!
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
All stop, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
I can't get power, sir!
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
How're you doing?
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
Wake up, man, wake up!
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
No, <u>my</u> name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Shields, aye.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
"Neutralized?" How?
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
Memory problems, too.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
What do you mean now?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Spock...?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
What is our condition?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
I'll have to re-energize.
The whales...?!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Well, that's different.
That's the ticket, laddie.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Sometimes I do.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
A planet in Federation space...
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir?
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
No, sir...
... Population three hundred million...
What you're doing to my neck...
All hands. Battle stations!
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Do you know what this is, Data?
What year is it?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Captain --
Captain, the Enterprise!
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Were the two of you... involved?
I'd say you already have.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
No. It's a lot further than that.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Yes, sir.
Agreed. Options?
Are you alright?
We've lost Bridge control!
Someone...?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge.
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
No!
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Specifically of...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
I was nervous -
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
My God, what happened here?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He just tried to save him!
Spoken by you?
Course heading, Captain?
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
WE volunteered?
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Never been this close.
Spock, I'm really tired...
Captain...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Close enough to beam down?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
I don't want to.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
No.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
So... To happy endings.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
You have a red shirt.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What programs were accessed?
I'll take care of it, sir.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
To find the head, sir?
Captain!
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
And the Senate supports you?
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I don't know.
I am.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
How long until we reach the Rift?
What?!

Right in line with that burning tree.
I don't see anything.
You have one with two beds?
I'll have to run your card off now.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
I understand.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Hello George.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
This is George Fox...
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Steering wheel.
Dashboard.
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Space?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
You want to try it?
Horses.
Three nights... two days.
Is that a baby?
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Can I have the gun?
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
What?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
That was beautiful.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
I feel better if I move.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
What are you saying?
Good morning.
Yes, they are.
But...
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I will.
In the cars, too?!
I don't know where he is.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Very beautiful country up here...
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
I don't understand.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
You should feel like shit.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But this is a bad one.
Looks like she was holding out.
What do you mean?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
About what?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Your sex life?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
It was a tough call.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Hi there.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Jesus.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Not bad, huh?
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Maybe cause he's smart.
What are you doing?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
Do you think he singled you out?
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Doesn't fit.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
You got a point there.
And one other thing.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
I already have an employer.
Maybe you should back off.
Is he dead?
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
I've been to Chicago.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
"MyDick?"
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
How far is Amarillo?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I know, I know.
Ever since I've known you.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
You should call your Grandmother.
I'm sorry?
Yes. Like the quiche.
To do what?
Anything.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Who's your booking agent?
I'll be around.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I mean, I need the money.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Kinda money, huh?
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
They turned you down?
It's kinda money, actually.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Not well.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
S'up Trent?
What Vegas?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
She smiled baby.
You gotta do it.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
I don't think so.
Yeah, a good friend.
What?
You looked right at her, baby.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
You're money.
Sorry man.
Be smart about it.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Understood.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I'll think about it.
Is it necessary?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
And this?
What miracles you do for strangers.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Yes.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Corleone.
You tell us about America.
Yes.
I know about what you mean!
Mike!  The party starting!
Was there a definite proposal?
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You like spaghetti?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael, I love you.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael.
Hello.  Kay?
Don't you want dinner first?
I'm busy.
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Cut it out.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you renounce Satan.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Can you mix a martini?
This is so good of you.
Could we sail to Venice?
And Rome.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Shoes too?
I thought you'd missed the train.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I've got plans!
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
How?
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Are you okay?
Tom?
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What's funny?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
How did you know that?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I know.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
You know what -- I am.
Will we see you later?
And tomorrow?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Was who Meredith?
Well that would be even better gossip.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
I don't know...
Yes?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
The singer?
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
Hello, Travis.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Oh, Tom, please.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Cops don't do nothin.
I sure hate to go alone...
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Why?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
Wrong.
What, vou?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
I see you got the telegram.
How'd it go?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
I think  it's worse  now.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Why me?
How'd they get it inside?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What was that?
Nothing.  
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
No wallet, huh?
Mother o'god...
When did I leave?
Nine and-a-half years ago.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Exactly.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
What exactly did you hear?
Yes.  Very.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
I suspected as much.
A trifle.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I see.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Cathy!
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
The little Brenner girl.
No, it's Lois!
Where does he live?
See them two big trees across there?
I see. How do I get down there?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
If they are?
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
No.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
No, of course not.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
How do you know Annie?
You like me, huh?
With... with Annie, of course.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
What?
Will I be seeing you again?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Yes.
So you didn't go to school together.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Do you expect me to believe...?
Like what?
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Last night? What do you mean?
Really? Tell me about it.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
After the gulls attacked.
Don't let's take any chances.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
When will they stop?
Almost two a.m.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
And he'll talk?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Birds?
We need them.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
He's not home.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Well? And are you not a good student?
I can't believe that.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
No.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Don't call me that confounded name.
I am the best man for the job.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
Only Brother.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You've been with Gray again.
Where are they?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Where is it? This place?
Where the fuck did you come from?
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
How do you know?
No...
Erin. It's not your fault.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I know.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Fucking crow.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Hi Mom!
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Of course, dear.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
I don't believe it.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
Well, we could--
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Naturally I think so.
I want to know what he told you last night.
Just twelve.
Who?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I -- I thought you were--
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
What?...
Oh, no...
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Good!
No.  Just you.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
We're getting close...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
What did you say?
But, Mom...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
Why not?
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
You're beautiful.
Go away.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Now why'd you go and...
What?
Let's open it.  Now...
What do we do about those three?
Garry's missing!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Neither will we.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
No.
Four!
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
So what do you make of it?
I had an accident.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Where?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
This has to end.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
What's your name?
Created?
As slaves.
How?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Why?
And why not?
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
I mean... well... affection.
A moonstone.
You're late.
Alex...?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Let them.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
For God's Sake, David --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I know that --
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
This... was my home.
Oh, that explains everything.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
All of you?
What's it all for?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
It's undamaged?
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
May I get you some --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
Where do they take them?!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
Sir, if I may --
Kalen...
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Then don't.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
I need to get this letter to someone.
No, it hasn't.
Why?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
What're those?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
I don't know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I think so.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
And if I didn't want to come?
Why, what would you do?
[Beat] I don't know.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How...how do you know?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
[Beat] How do you know?
It's gonna be sticky.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
You want a drink?
[Beat] Why?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Who do you think did it?
You girls are in some hot water.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
A .38.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
Tell me.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
What the fuck is going on?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Will I be?
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
She thinks he's a pig.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Try to.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
What little dogs?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
You know why.  You already said.
Thelma, that is not an option.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
He said they're charging us with murder.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can live in a hacienda.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
What?!  What d'you think?!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Hey, look on the bright side --
Wait a second, I never told you that.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Uh-huh.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Here's the info you asked for.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
By the way, what's your name?
What's that?
That sounds like fun.
Deco.
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
I guess.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Well, I know you're busy...
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
So she's married?
Huh?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
You know, I really should take your card.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
So who's the lucky guy?
I don't watch the new ones.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
What's up, Doc?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Huh?
Hi, Ted.
Oh... are you... ?
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
Eh.
Piggyback ride.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Oh, still sore about this.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
What's it about?
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
When are you going to be home?
Hey, sport. You winning?
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Hey.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
It ain't Geronimo.
You crashed my file?
I did.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Couldn't sleep.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Jesus, you alright?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What you call myths, we call our history.
It's not real.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
How so?
It would have been really embarrassing!
No.
How about what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
I'm different.
You're an animal.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Are you really that brave?
Well no...inverse order.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
I want it back.
One more.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
MAVERICK.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
I'm pulling up.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
280, 290, 300 knots.
Is there something I should know?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
That's not what I heard.
No shit. The Iceman....
You think you can stay up with us.
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
I've seen this before.
You won?!!!
Bad?
Yes sir.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
For the same reason you are.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
I called your house.
Or....
Where's yours?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Get it, please.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Do you expect me to believe you?
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Amazing.  Where are we?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
You open it.
What is it?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
On his way.
You tell me.
I don't know.  Maybe.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
He's not at ground level.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Who?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
I'm not your wife.
Nice to meet you.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
I love you.
This is too weird.
Forget I said wife.
The reactor.
What reactor?!
You sure about this?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
No problem.
You can't fight'em that way...
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Well, sure.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
What the hell are they?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Don't he have a home to go to?
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Yeah, geography.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
-- With objection!
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
You can't remember that -- !
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
You're implying that I planted a gun?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
You really think that's what happened?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
I embellished.
A fucking wheelchair?
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Exactly what happened then?
-- About what?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
I don't think I know that name.
It's okay. It was always like that.
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Tell me some other things about her.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Did she ever mention any friends?
What do you mean?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
You better dust this place, Sam.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
James called me last night looking for you.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Laura, I am your friend.
How did the car get back here?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You missed somethin', Ed.
The pages are gone. That's real.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Did you make me a tape?
What? She asked about my father?
It does matter. We're in love.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You know it and I know it.
Bobby killed a guy.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Dad...
A friend from school.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
I'm fine.
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
...tell me about this case.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
It's a crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I... yes.
I do. Yes.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Thank you. When Debby...
Well, many reasons, actually...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
That's what I'd planned to...
...I made a reservation at...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Right. Who called?
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
I understand.
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
A single hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And are they going to get it?
What happened...?
I've got to work...
And it's over...?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
Pardon?
Missus...
Nothing happened.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
It's locked.
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...You saw her?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...now who is that...?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Right.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
...four years ago...
She did?
What?
Yes.
What's he like?
How'd you guess?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
That needle ain't pointing north!
Right.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just be careful, okay?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
DO you mind...
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
What...what is that?
What are you talking about?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
Listen, dammit.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Robert?  I...
Yes?
What?
Guilty.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Make us proud.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Where you going?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
I just can't believe it.
What was that?
What's the difference?
What the hell is going on?
What'd you do?
What are they doing?
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
What is it we can do for you today?
I can take care of myself.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
It matters to me.
We've got a problem.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
He climbed when he was ready.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
No.
I understand.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Yessir.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
That is my permiso.
But I'm wild at heart.
...Asshole.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Hasta siempre.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
What is it, Johnnie?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
And?
You're perfect for me, too.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
They sure do stink.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
What's that, honey?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Huh?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
And no AC.
You find any work?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's the kind liked it.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
LULA!!!!
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Course I am, mama.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Yes.
Get rid of him?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
No.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Your wife.
Mm.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
So modest.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
I'll be... somewhere else.
How long have you been having them?
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
With Emily?
No! What gave you that idea?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Heaven?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
You?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Afraid so.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Glaucoma?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Yes, James.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
That good, huh?
Chancellor.
All right. This morning --
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Inside.
Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
And what did you say?
Ouch. How many?
I told Walter.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Oh?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where's Emily, Hank?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
I might have his number on campus.
Five years.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
Is it because of Anna?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
Isn't it?
I'm just talking, man.
Sure.
There's a million birds here.
Is that right?
Why not?
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
Do you come here often?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Yeah.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Yes.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
No way.
You don't like coming here, do you?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Then why are you talking about this?
I'm not that crazy.
I couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
Is this the first one?
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
Why?
I'm relaxed.
Not so fast.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
A nap?
How do you feel about that?
What?
I'm all right.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
What's weird about that?
I'm just quiet.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
The morning?
Did I say something wrong?
What was prison like?
They seduce you?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I love my brothers.
You never asked them about it?
What?
Live together.
Sneak up behind me like that.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
What are you still wearing that for?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
What about O-2?
Bud, something really important is happening here.
No.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Well, that's that.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
It is insane.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
SHIT!
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
But you just said that a month was too...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
And where do you find the models?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Unfortunately, no.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
What boat?
They didn't seem too good.
Through someone else?
I can't say.
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Why?
Agnes...
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Why?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
In the middle of all the pain?
I... I don't understand.
Would you like to ask them?
Are you married?
No questions.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What things?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
She...
Yes.
Why?
Yes.
To help me.
I'm frightened.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Because I was afraid.
I ate.
My bed.
What else?
Agnes, can you hear me?
How did she know about him?
So she sent you?
I hate him for what he did to me.
I'll have it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
No.
You can call me Sister.
Two packs a day.
What man had access to her?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
I am...
There's another choice.
What?
How?
Earthquakes?
Nothing.
Sister Paul?
She molested her!
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Nothing...
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Do you think they ever existed?
Of course.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
Who is he?
She is an innocent.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
How about Ding Dong?
Shurrup!
Sure.
I'll murder that Lennon.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
He hasn't.
Oh, there you are!
How'd you guess?
What's that mean?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Yeah ... that's right.
A book!
You're only right.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Have they?
What are you doing?
Come on let's get this coffee.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Anything to spare?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
I hope he fell off.
Behave...
Y'what?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Now get on with it.
Is it?
Oh, leave off!!!
He belongs to Paul.
Who?
Down the ... er ...
But John hasn't got any.
What?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Do you remember the pyramid?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
Breathe deeply.
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Where's it coming from?
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
It's really on there tight.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
What do you mean, no?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
This is horrible.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
How far?
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
There, it caught!
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
They're getting pretty close now.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
What film?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Engaged.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Kill me...
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Yeah, it's fine.
Give or take.
Shit.  When?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Still got him?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
They've changed their heading again.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
That's the wrong way!
What can I do?
Phoebe?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
That's right.
Yes. I do.
Eddie...
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
You have no right to say such things!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Then say so.
You can have one at Max's.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Didn't you know?
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill!
Where?
Nothing?
I told her. I sounded off.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
What?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
She's a girl of so many interests.
So she seems.
Thank you.
Nothing, really...
It's all over.
Gone.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Lemme fix you a drink.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Behind in your dues? How much?
Night an' day.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How did you get in here?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Subway.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Not at all.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Oh, no. I see the play.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
I think she would cheer.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
Oh, but there is-
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Something most important you can do.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Not at all...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Three or four miles...
Not to you. Not to Bill.
With tears?
With tears.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
Now just a minute-
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
You get quick action, don't you?
But what could she do?
Are you breaking the contract?
--it was fine the way it was--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--mine's better--
Carl?
Yeah?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--what do you think?--
July of '71.
Goddamnit--
And?--And?--
Who's first?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Republican?
When?
--I know, I know--
How high up, which Republicans?
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
I didn't do anything wrong.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Sure--off the record.
--that was awhile ago--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
Hey, easy...
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Just tell me his title.
I got Clawsen on hold--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Haldeman too?
There were more then.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Where in government?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
I did all right on McCord.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--has any of them got an ax?--
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Why are you doing this?
You talked to Stifler?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
What?
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Went home to shit.
But, but -- what would I do?
Holy shit.
Yes.
Dad!!
What was your name again?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yeah, bring it on!
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
God dammit, Stifler!
Kevin, this is serious!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
I'm such a loser.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
NOVA!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
Keep it down, dude.
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Ha-ha!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Serafine...
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Where?
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
We know you were with her.
What?
Not you too -
Uncle Terrence.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
Claude.
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
What've you got?
Saint Severin...
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Where is your home, Anya?
Come out! I can do alterations.
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
Come on!
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Oh! I'm sorry...
Dmitri?
Do you remember this?
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
How do you know?
Bartok... a question.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
Rasputin!
What do you want?!
I'll show you!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
And tell me that she's happy.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Hey, you on television?
Who are you?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Allison.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Yeah!
Oh, all right.
Okay?
Look, look at that guy.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah?
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
I didn't follow you!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
I'm following you and David, if you-
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Yeah.
Oh. What?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Commentary.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Where are you going?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Yeah, watch the road!
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
What's the matter?
Yeah. Right.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
You think so? Do you really?
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
There were many men interested in you?
Very well.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You don't have any clothes on.
He's allergic.
Oh.
Well, probably.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You should have brought him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Anymore.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
What is it?
You need to call your dad.
Leave us alone right now.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Scout's honor.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce.
About me!
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I'll never forgive you.
I'll be with you.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
I know.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Yes.
Joking.
I meant Sally.
And you know, he really does not.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I will treasure this.
I've never done this before.
Sorry?
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I think there are sixteen there.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Well, yes, actually.
They're nothing like us.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Ready to go?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I so wish I'd known.
I'm sorry.
Come on in.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Yes.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Okay.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
Everyday.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Thank you, Panes.
Yes.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You don't need to do that.
Yes.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Why are you doing this?
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Well...  I declared war!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Out here I'm just what?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Affirmative.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
ARREST HIM!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
What do you see out there?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
Something the matter?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Sheldrake?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Two o'clock.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
And where are you now?
What's your friend's name?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Thank you.
I guess so.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You did?
We're going to finish that gin game.
That's very wise.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Sir?
Who?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
You like?  It's all yours.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
You can't come in.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
What's this -- you packing?
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Not so rough, honey.
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Come on, Fran.
Will you excuse me?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I never said goodbye, Fran.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You know I do.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
The nerve.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Dreadful.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Yeah.
Sometimes.
What do you see?
Yeah, I know.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Flood.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
I --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Who knows? Right.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Touchy.
What -- happened here.
I thought he was a lame.
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
I'm Kurtz.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Yeah, I like it...
How's yours?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
The other one --
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
102  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Let's go.
What's going on?
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Yeah?
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
What's wrong?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Neff, you know better than this...
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
I'm too old for this shit.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
His name?
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
What about your mother?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Lovely.
You take off when you have to.
Hello?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Hello.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
Go ahead.
What do you want?
Because...
Boyfriend?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
I'm not saying nothing to you.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
That's right.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Game over, bitch!
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Get on the expressway.
An assassin?
Who is that other guy?
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
How?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
With computers.
I killed him.
Where you wanted to be?
Why not?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
Why?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Tell me about the first time.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
I don't know.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Here?
Really?
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
That's right.
We split the money?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Yes.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
Were you attracted to me right away?
Why?
Shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Would you like a drink?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
I hope not.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
A dime.
What are you thinking about?
Some.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Oh yeah, what's that?
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
So why didn't we?
You capitalist pig!
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
I can't go with him.
You're sure?
That one?
So am I.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
What?
Will it help to get you out?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
It's not so much.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Okay?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Seems a shame!
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Uh-huh!
Where did you steal the car?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
When the hell did you write that?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You are quite sure it's secure?
You are responsible...What has happened?
And what of these foreigners?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Late night.  You?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I'm thinking.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
Were?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
What the -- ?!
I'll get something for us to drink --
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
She great or what?
Yes. But not as a date date.
I have to get you home by one.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
What do you actually know with religion?
I might do it wrong.
Loved?
What would you do up here?
Mars.
You planned this --
Jamie --
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
How're you doing?
This week.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
No.
Materially or spiritually?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
Yeah.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Learn anything?
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
I'm going to be at the dance.
Operator...
March 11th.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Professor? Professor Brown?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Perfect...
You didn't?
What theater was I at?
Dick? Dick who?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
What'd you come out here for?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
What for?
You still in school?
Doing what?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
You know what I think?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Are you sure?
How's he doing?
Is he upset?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
What's that?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
It's mine all right.
New Jersey?
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
You okay?
We will, old fried, we will.
Anybody we know?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
What is it, Tommy?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
She was killed, Penny.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Hah!
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
It's still a little early for me.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
I don't understand-
I didn't say anything-
To do what?
What do you do far a living?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Charlie. How are you.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
It's okay, it's okay.
Yeah, but –
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Fink.
Yes sir, they –
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Is this multiple choice?
What did... What did he –
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Well, some of his throat was there.
We got a treatment on it yet?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
You okay?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
You should do something about this lock.
About a year and a half.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Did I miss something?
Even though you were fucking him.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Why not?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
No.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
When?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Did you miss me?
I'm writing a book.
Why?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Was she ever suspect?
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
I'm going with you.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
On what basis?
Did you check all four years?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Naa..
Let's get out of here.
Of what?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
No.
I'm here.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Out?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
You're shattering all my myths.
So then what?
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
I guess you did.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
... babies.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
How is he?
That is amazing. What year is it?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Can you put me in the ring with him?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Hey, Rene.
I didn't know.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I guess this mean we won.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
"We"?  You and...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nor I, on the second.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Specify, please.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Who's Ivy?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
The dreams again, sir?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He ran away?
How are you feeling, young man?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Mystery.
My life's an open book. You read?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Fast work. You just moved here.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Excuse me.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is it?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I got family. ...Please.
How'd you find us?
Holy shit.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
A-14.
How high up would you say that is?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
How much do you weigh?
How'd you find this place?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I understand.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Joker here. Can we talk?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Not what?
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Go ahead.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Everything's gonna be fine.
Two dollars please.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Right first time.
Ahm.....
What happened?!!!
It's very good Bernie.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
She's ... well, she's good.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Everything okay, David?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
And a car.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Of course he is.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
And Boot-Head.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Me first.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Cut the power!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
D.C., Chief.
Where are his pants?
Do her? Huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, ten uh...
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Aren't you scared?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Just get some people out of our house.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
We're very unhappy.
What about Betelgeuse?
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
How'd you do on the science test?
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
I think so.
I don't know what that signal means.
Just <u>say</u> it.

Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Why not?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Oh, fine.
Yes.
It's fine today, Robert.
No, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
... Do you think we should look for him?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Yes.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Hello, Sid.
No. I'm not busy.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I certainly do.
I agree.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
No, Ben.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
I can't read.
Yes. I like to watch.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I agree.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Since you were a child?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Ben, really...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
I can certainly understand that...
No! He's a real gardener!
Gardiner, yes, sir.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
Right, Chief.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Malkovich.
The monkey.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
The ferret?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
Why?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
What about Maxine?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
The iguana?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Yes?
I said "yes."
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
I am a trained performer.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
No.
Yessir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Moving story.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Just.
You married?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
This is important!
You're evil, Maxine.
Let him try.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Do you dream often?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Great then.
You still there, sweets?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
You've got to be kidding.
Captain Mertin?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Not like He punished me.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
She gone like they say?
Yes?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Well, what can you do?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
But mama..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Better ask Paul D.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Aw, no, Ella.
Till she showed herself.
What run him off? Tell me that!
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Jesus.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Hiya Allan.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Yeah, it sucks.
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Fuckin' A.
What tied the room together, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No it's fine, really, uh--
The main guy, Dieter--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Delayed after-eff--
What happened to your house?
Jeffrey--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
No, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
What the fuck is going on there?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
"Our" car, Walter?
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Yeah.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
Dude?
Huh?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Walter, you fuck!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Yeah?
Dude here.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Who the hell is he?
Shit, sorry man.
You happy, you crazy fuck?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What was that?
how long since he was bitten?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
What do you really think?
What's your problem, Whistler?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Tell me something, Skid --
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
You should've killed her, then.
No longer.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
What is this place?
Just get out of here.
You don't look so good.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
You.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Whistler!
How?
Try, please, Anna--
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
Baby names?
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--you should get back into bed.
Absolutely.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Okay, a blur.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
What?
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Why?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What'd you see?
He'll never know.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
What?
That's why she kills children.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Anna--
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
--yes--
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...Well I'll be damned.
...You ever get tired?
...What?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
What do you want to know?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
Remy.
What?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Uh-huh.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
No.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Then what'd you come here for?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
What do you think?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
What day is it today, Angie?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What color is it?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Who's this fuck?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
Frank gone?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
See my nipples?
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
What do you want to do?
I asked first.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Who, Dorothy?
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Heineken.
Here's to Ben.
Nothing.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Maybe so.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Yes. I do.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
He got a little jealous.
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah?
Who, me? Why should it?
You were late.
What am I going to do?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Hi Dad.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
No. you're right.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
What is?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
And I only deal with you?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Oh my G-d.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Just a friend.
We're half a million off.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Derek Foreal.
No more brothers, Diego.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
In how long?  A week?
Well, you know.  It's um...
Surprised to see me?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tell Mom, you know...
Figured it out.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
She did that before.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What do you want from me?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Okay, George.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
Of course. As soon as possible.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
It could've happened to anyone.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
Cause?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Yes.
Sex.
No -- never.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Why did you come by?
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Did you suggest any?
No.
I was angry.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
I heard him say it.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
That bastard!
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I thought the subject was sex?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
Can I see you later?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
If you want me to.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
What time did you leave?
No -- never.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Well, that's a long time.
Oh Jesus.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Yeah.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Why?
He's very... clean.
Is the dizziness gone?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
Smells like dirt.
When?
You must get lonely at times.
But no one in particular.
No, I'm just saying --
What made you ask such a question?
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
How about Italy?
I sat outside and had coffee.
No. I couldn't.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
What about us? What about me?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
Want anything special for dinner?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
They're not going to find her!
Then what do you care?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Are you nuts?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
'S up?
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Where's the gangsta of love?
That's what?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Aren't you going to join us?
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
I can't find you.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
But --
You gotta use your imagination.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
What's that, Johnnie?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
She's doing the work herself.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Violet, please!
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
I need you ...
What are you doing?
Where is the money?
I had to.  You made me.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
What?  How about a drink?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
We was worried about you, Cease.
Yeah.
Call me as soon as you get him.
Who?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
'63 Chevy.
Why?
No.
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Even though he knew about you?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah, twice.
Where will you be?
I'm just asking, what if?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Done.  We go now.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
What do you mean?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
I think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Who do you think sent me?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes.  Is he there?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We thought you were gone for good.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I want to go home.
I said ten thousand.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
But the police --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
This your store?
Get in the basement.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
What's that?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
<u>Where am I</u>?
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
What do I have to do.
It's reply paid.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
What?
Christ! You do know it all!
Er ... no.
You're the only person I can trust.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
I didn't like it.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Turn around!
Get away!
"And your children all gone."
Please, Jill ... I love you.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
It's not our mistake!
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
No, sir.
But I could be anybody.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What is it?
What is it?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're going to live.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Okay, what happened?
He's going to be all right, right?
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Do you have any music?
What?
I know him. That's Noel.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
No.
She should go home.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He's better.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
How long you been doing this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Frank.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'll drink to that.
He one of them?
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
How can that be? He was getting better.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
The brakes are shot.
You okay?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
You packing up tonight?
Hold it down, okay?
You know what I...
Hi.
Okay.
A half hour in the lobby.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
We can cut back at the end.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Don't go.
This isn't friendship.
Don't say anything about anything.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Yes.
Stop it.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
They're not really going to call security are they?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Is everything all right?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Why so glum?
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
Go ahead -- what?
Are you okay?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Are you nervous, Walter?
What the hell's going on?
Look at the size of it!
Oh yeah?
More champagne, your majesty?
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Here you go, enjoy.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I wonder what his deal is.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
It's hot in here...
I can't talk right now.
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Are you done with these?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I don't think so Mayolia.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
You think?  Split?
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Didn't you get my message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Well, stay here tonight.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
You were supposed to be here at three.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Time to do what?
Everybody does.
China.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
We'll cover it later.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
But you threw a knife at my head!
Oh.  Sorry.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Thanks.
I can't!
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
And Spring Fling.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Buffy!
Like you've got a grip.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You said "Crash".
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Crash...I want you.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
You need a nickname.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Who's he play for?
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
He did know.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Jesus.
What's wrong?
Settle what?
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
Pussy.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
What'you want, kid?
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
What are you talking about?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
You were never my guest?!
Liar.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
I don't know.
No, of course not.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Hello.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
All right, fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
You lost your control.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
I'll come by.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Who's this?
I-I'll do it.
She took care of the dealers...
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Oh, it's so soft.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
You didn't have to beat him up!
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay?
He wanted a watch, too.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I put her to bed.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
You fuckin' whore!
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Get - get up!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Well...
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
You're firin' me?
Well, I... I never tried.
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
Mm.
No, no? You didn't?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Can I go in?
Leave me alone!
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's gone?
Artie!
Artie! Artie!
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
What're you gonna do?
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
No problem.
Ace.
Hi, how are you?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
No, he's not.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
...all the luck in the world.
You do?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
It means I got the money.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
You know why, right?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
You walk past me?
And this is Stacy.
It's up to you.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No, no, no, no!
Charlie M.
Tony.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
Hi.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You know, nobody likes you...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Hmm. Not bad.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I've been looking for you.
Winning.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
You're late.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
This is one way.
Who's on the phone?
Say something ...
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
A woman?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
A price on everything.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What do you mean?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
What's going on?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I thought it was inspired.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You could've hit me.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
They did some great job of reforming you.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
They saw you kill the driver.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
We don't see you.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
It's in the process.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And then?
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Call me "Nels."
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Yeah?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
How do you know?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Is that good or bad?
You could always make it up to her.
He's still looking, Col.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Who?
You American?
Jimmy.
He wants me to perform for him.
He's getting up.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Yes, please.
No.
Are you jealous of him?
What would he think?
Did he come here too?
Can't leave me now.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Don't.
Yes.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Why?
You heard what I said, Dil?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You killed my Jody
You didn't.
Yes.
Never.
I promise.
Lucky you.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Perfect.
You may be right.
You a handyman, Fergie?
So?
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Would make me feel better about it.
So it was you all the time.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Right.
Right.
What is it now?
Not in your nature.
No.
Absolutely not.
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Shouldn't take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now put it back in.
Why?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
See if she's all right.
What?
When I was a child...
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
All right -- where's the letter?
I could eat a horse.
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
But I didn't kill anybody.
You lied to me so many times --
I said, tell me to go to the --
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
I believe you.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
But --
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Not my room!
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Does it hurt?
Sure.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Okay.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Alex --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No -- not yet.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
How much is it worth?
Forty-five thousand.
Tell me what?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Of course it is.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
You mean you and me?
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Go on.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Please stop -- please!
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Have you no idea who could have done it?
How can you tell?
I don't see him.
Yeah? What's that?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Hi honey.
What's wrong?
It was a she.
What did you hear?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Well?
She's still a virgin.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
I can.
Yes.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I was desperate. It was gross.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
You can't tell your parents.
This place is empty.
Don't you think it's sick?
No.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
I'll think about it.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Did he say anything else about her?
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
What?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Did you want one?
You can have both if you want.
Hide your laptop here.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Unfair?!

help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
...shit.
Damn.
Come on, Night Shift.
Where's Sam?
Great. 
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...truck.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
That dog ain't mean.
Are you kiddin'?
Damn.
Borrowed.
You stole this truck! That's...
Okay, okay! 
...-ed.
Oh, shit.
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
 Yeah...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Come on, old...
Goddamn!
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Whoo!
 I made it.
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
 Gee, you think so?
 Shit. 
Okay.
 Aw, shit  
...to him!  You don't know who...




Okay.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...or nephew or some good old boy...
So you took his...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...-er.  It was your friend...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
I think you oughta cut a...
Are you all right?
What?
Reach into my pocket.

Oh.

Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
  I've got the real thing!
What?
Oh.


Sorry.
Let's go!

 Well.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
You, Arlo.
Us.  Owes us.
Patriotism is its own reward.
 Yeah.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
I was undercover as a tennis player.


To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
You look good, Richard.
...-ple.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.




It's clean.
...-ther orders?
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Yeah?
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Go.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
...tight!
It's not over, Brynner.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

...try this one out some-...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
The compound has to be kept cold...
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...you, Mason?
We've got the real thing!
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
Got that?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!

 Listen, Pappas...
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
Don't move!
 

Look at that.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
A ruler?
Probably.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
None.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
No.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Is she all right?
Oh, my, yes.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Oh they don't?
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Summer colds are the worst.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
It's too late.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
What are you having?
My husband's at the office.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Of course I'm sure.
The Valley?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Just... I have to.
You mean she just found out?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Let me handle that.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh, good.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
You're a married man, am I right?
Have we ever met?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.
What about the water?
When it comes.
That's a long fall.
No, really?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He owned the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
You don't say?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
You weren't expecting me?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Elena!...But when...
No...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
I didn't see that.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Who else you been to see?
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Ask them to sit down.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
We haven't heard from him.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
A chicken?
I didn't say.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Half past eleven.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Tired?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Good.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
What?
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Rawlston is my boss.
Yes.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yeah, all in crates.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
I know, but -
Yes, sir.
Well, thanks a lot.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
God, isn't he great?
You're kidding.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
How do you know that?
No.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
I'm giving him his ring back.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Like what?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
What time was this?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
That's easy to say from over here.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Cute cat. What's his name.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What do you two fight about?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That girl was vile to you.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
The Emperor.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
And the second time around...?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Can we talk about this later?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
Pull my laces tighter.
Helluva game!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
She meant nothing to you!
Oh, my god.
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
What, your dick?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
What?
And this is what you rented?
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Now I know you're lying.
What did she say?
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
You didn't have to choke me.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
A half hour.
With you? I don't think so.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Veronica.
She's my girlfriend.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
The porno mags?
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
What were you doing?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Something wrong?
How many girls have you slept with?
Why'd you hit me?
Three including you.
No; who were the three, besides me?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
He requested this?
You sucked that guy's dick?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I hope it feels good.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
The guy ain't here yet.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I have first dibs.
Bye. 
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
I'm coming out!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Four...five...
Do you see them yet?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I don't think you do.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Reach up!  Do it!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Murdering, motherfucker...
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Yeah...
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
What's the delay?
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Richard Travers.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Great, sir. Great.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
It's alright, thank you.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
What do I want?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Religion?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
You've heard Beethoven before?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Yes.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Sir, 655321, sir.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
D'you think we should do something?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Max...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Jesus...
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I'm sorry.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
So?  It was a random thing.
Oh?
What if they're wrong?
...if they're wrong?!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
I got caught up at work.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Who is this?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
It's home.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Max.
The trunk?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What?
How can you kill him like that?
Who was he?
I can't believe this.
I listen to classical.
What you mean, no?
Show up for what?
She's in the hospital.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
In case he asks.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Who?
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Some living.
That's what you said...
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Mississippi?
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
People do have heart attacks.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Yeah.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
So why are they after you?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Pretty scary, huh?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Liza?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Then tell me what happened.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Do I know you?
<u>Liza</u>!
You made your decision yet?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
And you feel bad for it?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
The truth shall make you free.
We're very specialized.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
That you come with me.
What in the hell...?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
J39 Z186...?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear to the moon?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
So.  What happens now?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Hokkaido Island.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Peter Valerian.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
But what about your research -- ?
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Like it or not.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
If you came back.
Something like that.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't follow.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So.  The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
Ellie, what is it?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
-- I don't know --
I can't hear this now --
Hi.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Recommendations?
But I made this arrangement --
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Buck is a deal.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Gotta go, Arletta.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Pair'a nines.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
So then you just call him.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
You just said he could eat anything.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
When are you going to call them?
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Yes.  Without question.
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
The first two murders.
When he was seventeen.
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
In jail.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Who?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
We'll show that to...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
Maybe you should...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
Open the door.  Please.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
I heard. Good police work.
Answer it.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
There was no sperm.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
He's not treating her right...
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Not a lot of action here.
It's about time.
You're not envious?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I thought that was you, up there.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Do we have to talk about this?
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
How can I help?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure, Dear?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Which flowers did you order?
Honestly, Letty.
I'm really not that hungry.
Green spot.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
What have you done with the ring?
A small price.
No.
A daisy for the lady.
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Michael, I...
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Tell me all.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Not yet.
The store was busy.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Are you all right?
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Who?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
How's it look?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
It's me...
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Okay.   How much?
Why are you here?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Get that, will you?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
That moron.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We still have to get out of here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hello?
Anybody hungry?
What?
Can I trust you, Sami?
You haven't answered my question.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
What?
What'd they take?
Everything.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Good song though.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
I'm the driver.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
What the hell is he talking about?
Going somewhere?
Me?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
How?
No shit?
Yeah, I dig him.
Glenmorangie.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
You like shoes?
It's for you.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Tell me, who is your master?
Hello.  What is your name?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You, sister...
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
You shouldn't have come.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Good.  And how are you?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
I left the training early.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
What about you?
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.
Fucking A, my friend.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I don't know you.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Don't waste my time.
What... the hell is that?
That's right.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You what?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
A friend wrote me.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Please.
Why not?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
Of Human Bondage.
Oh please.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Am I bothering you?
Why are you doing this?
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Please don't go.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Would you like a tour?
Where did you say she's from?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
What was that?
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
You'd do that for me?
Does your mother know?
Well did you like it?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Need any company?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Who told you?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
What's wrong?
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Loser.
That her?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
You're too kind.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Let me get that for you.
I need to talk to Annette.
Annette! Annette!
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Oh, hello.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
How?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, lots of times.
Oh, thank you, darling.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I know that.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
I got lots of presents.
Certain wishes do.
These are all from me.
Daddy!
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Daddy?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I can not tell you.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Will you come soon?
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Who is she?
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
No, thank you.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Wow your body's really hot.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
He's a very talented musician.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
How'd it go with the cop?
Charming Carlton.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
What? Why'd you do that?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
Peter knows something.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Frida? You okay?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
Knock what off?
Uh huh. So pee.
So pee? Here?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
On your desk.
Coffee and...
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
So what book did you buy?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
You had a date with Carlton?
Is it that funny?
They do? Oh no...
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Worse than this?
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Not really...
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
How will we interrogate them?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Lost something?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
But...  How long has this been happening?
Yes.
Can I get my life back?
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Don't say a .
Where's the girl?
Till what?
Up and around?  Soon?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
And...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Just what you think I mean.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
That'd be great.
I'm not sure... I might have.
At a press conference.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Alan...
And it's proving quite effective...
Something like what...
You're not?
Really?
Yeah.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Who?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Mind if I sit down?
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You're leaving?
You1re leaving, too?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
What about the intro?
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
His madness....could be from shock.
Tonight?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
No, sir.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
But...
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
What happened?
You fucked up little prick!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox, I don't believe this!
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
I'm sorry, Neil.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
Look at this.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What is it then?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
What is that supposed to mean?
From my father and Nolan.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
How do we get out of here?
Who?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
That's where my boat's moored.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Quite a few.
Anti social?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
What?
...Jagger was here...I was here...
It's okay...come on...
Joey... Which way's aft?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
Joey...
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
Tell him, Vince!
I know! I fuckin' know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
It won't open.
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
How was huntin'?
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Hey, Nick...
Rough, huh?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
How's the trailer?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
What?
C'mon. I've got the car.
Who the hell is he?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Pow.
Is he from here?
You think we'll ever come back?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Merle...
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
Three bullets -- minimum.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
What do you mean, no???
Right.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
It's Merle, Sal.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Never one.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Funny guy.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Give it to me.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Sir, your limo's here.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Not the 'T' word.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Can I ask you something?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Married?
What's this place?
Yeah.
I'll be okay.
Hey, I'm eating.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
This is the guy that killed my partner.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Why? It don't hurt.
What's that, sir?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
What's the matter with you?
But what becomes of our souls?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Oh!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Well -- yes --
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Oh, Jabez.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
I'll get the doctor.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Well -- I -- I-
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
What's ailing that dog?
You found it in the barn, hey?
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
It is.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Jabez ...
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
You can talk to me ...
It's corny, but I could live with it.
What's happening?
How about his job?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Where are you going?
What are you going to do?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Who are you, then?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Put it down now.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
'Roy'.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
This is --
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
It looks like a whole roast.
What trip?
Why you going to Algeria?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
You don't have a choice?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Oh no!
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
I'm not alone.
Call me whatever you want.
Calm down, you're not ...
They were ...
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Yeah?
He's all doped up.
The gun's right on your back...
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
I'll be God damned if you will.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I didn't eat any pizza.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
You mean that?
What?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But I want to know what you think.
To show that we're negotiating.
What kind of a deal?
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I want them all.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
I said you were never a faggot.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Of course not ...
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Hello?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
<i>What is it?</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
I said stop it.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
How did you meet Choco?
No. What's the big deal?
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Not really.
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Talk to me.
My brother.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'm gonna leave now.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Make it plain.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Ten.
I'll see you out.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Innocent!
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
It's a fucking shame.
Let it be broke.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Can you pay me now?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Gotta go.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Shaddup, Vito.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Ya like him, huh?
That's what you think?
I'll do that.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Sez who?
I know this.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Yeah. How'd you know?
HARRY!
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Home school. Til today.
I go to school where I live.
Whoa. What was that?
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You're not my real dad.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Nice jugs.
You're it.
You're it.
How do you know it's for us?
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Shut up!
Do you want me to pet your head?
A raft.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I made the polar bear pants.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So can I come along?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Sure.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Obviously.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
God, I've missed you.
Everything?
Oh, just like the President.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Love it!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Yes?
So, this is Leto the Just...
Is this what you seek?
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Things have been so serious here lately.
Don't touch my mother...
Is he....?
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
We call that one Muad'dib.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
It's a pleasure...
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
But maybe not.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Don't you have any savings?
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
What do you mean?
This is kind of a stream--
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Ed, it was only one review.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It takes me comfortable.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I understand you just moved here?
For this one, we need $60,000.
What other sixty-thousand?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Yeah...?
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Mr. Reynolds!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Can I help you?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Huh?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
You don't wanna be noticed?
What's uncanny?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
Come on...
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Al!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ed --
Ed --
Take him off the air.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mm...  Oh, man...
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
He made a mistake.
I mean, that worked out.
Yes.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
Eddie...
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Our what?
Are you asking me?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Well, when you put it that way.
What are you doing?
Everybody hates me!
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's not their fault.
What?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Yeah?!
Great.
You watching the ballgame?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Good-bye, brother!
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Anything wrong?
Having a problem with your eye there?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Larry?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yeah.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I did it.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Still clear?
Yep.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
What do you mean?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
What do you want?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Merry Christmas.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
But you did it anyway.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
They're yours.  Take them.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Where are we going?
Yeah, that's Stens.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Say what?
Gone.  Not a trace.
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
But you were business associates?
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
You're wrong.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
I need to speak to you.
I want you to follow Bud White.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
On what evidence?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
What's he doing here, Sid?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Where'd you hear that?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Something like that.
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
When can you get it here?
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
That's who they are.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
We said a hundred.
I mean did you call anyone.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
How'd you have the manpower to--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Where?
Here?
What the fuck?!
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Is it okay?
Very good.
That's my point.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Just for the criminals.
What?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
He's got his priorities?
Robert--
I know.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know, but listen--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Well...yeah.
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
You don't know who the fuck--
Oh.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
He doesn't work that way.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
I know.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Mr. Dean--
Robert--
What are you talking--
Some of 'em.
Dad!
Do I know you?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They only took electrical appliances.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Why would the NSA--
Jerry--
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Jerry?
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
I need help.
Are you okay?
The police?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
Yes sir.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What happened?
We found the originals.
The originals?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What about--
What's your ETA?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Yes?
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.
No.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
You don't sew at all!
Now.
This is - what is this?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Shall we be all right?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Which we've overflown twice.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
May God make safety your companion.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I don't know what that means.
I liberated it.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Hana tells me you're leaving.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
The rest meant nothing to me.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Kip - come and dance with me
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Of course.  When?
Hello.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
He's sleeping.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
Kip?
What are you talking about?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Where are you at least?
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Uh, yes.
You disappeared.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
So what?
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
How much am I paying?
He says they turned the card down.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
True enough.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Let's do it again.
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
What?
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
What's that?
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Got it.
There's always a surprise.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Not for me.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Jesus God, it's going through.
I cannot get rid of you.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You look like George Washington.
You're giving them to me?
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
250,000?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What the hell is this doing here?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
How does someone get meningitis?
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
The what?
Any school you want.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
What are you doing here?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
This is the only thing you found?
It's not about working hard --
What do you mean?
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
So what are you thinking?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
She insulted me!
So why would PG&E offer it?
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Nope.  Maiden.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
How?
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
What are you doing here?
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
That is not what I'm --
What's going on?  What are you doing?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
It'll be fine, yeah.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Barks a blue streak.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Because of my father, I guess.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Does Luke know?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
That was no earthquake.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Stop that.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Get out of here, Lando!
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
You rest now.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I thought I was in good shape.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Zira, are you mad?
Go easy, Stevie.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Please
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You told me he was dead.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Can you land?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Locked.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Location.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
I'm looking for somebody.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Perceval, you have returned!
Whose son am I?
I want to thank you.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
How? Where?
At your service, sir.
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I'm going.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
And you cannot love me...
Because you and the land are one.
Very well. Climb up.
I will run.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hi
Hi, how'd your day go?
Just five or six people.
Where do you want this?
Me too.
Not that I know of.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Pretty close?
Sure did.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Could you see her?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Wanna drink.
Are you sure?
What's the difference?
What?
Is she gonna die?
Oh look at that.
You really don't want me to play huh?
He's nice.
I don't know
What?
How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
Oh my God!
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Do you like films?
Another one. Had your lunch?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
And let my cry come unto thee.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Only what I read in the papers.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Is that a threat?
Yes.
Twelve.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Trunks?
Teeth.
They're falling out.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
Get your hand off me.
How's the birthday girl?
Jack.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Why the interest?
No thanks.
Your older brother.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
No.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
Jack.
What's the matter?
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Oh, brother.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
We're gonna be here a week?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Because I can hear it.
Two hours ago!
She's a big girl.
What the hell are these?
The Royal.
Couple years.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
You're making things up, Frank.
What do you mean?
What're you doing?
What disease?
I didn't hear you come in.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Five years ago.  November.
Yes, it is.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Come on.
Hey!
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Hey, we're connected.
You're kidding me.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Funny job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
The name's Baker --
No.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
Nina?
Soap convention.
He called her.
Long story.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
We outgrew each other.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Ivory.
Fine.  You?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Nice-looking kid.
That's not the worst part.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Now what?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You mean like ... condoms?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
What happened?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
I'm not going anywhere.
-- Yes.
I'm going to the powder room.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Why Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
But I think I like you better this way...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
I think I could figure it out.
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
She said that?
It’s me, Jack...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Yes you do...
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
How much time?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
I don’t think so, thank you...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
All in one tape?
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
C’mon.
Thank you...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Worse, you mean...
And now...?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I could stay here forever...
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Kate...
You’re not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Not by a long shot.
No...I’m not...
Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Of course I did.
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I mean...
I'm not really dressed for a party.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
What?
Back it down, Johnny!
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What?
That's what we're here to find out.
Are you kidding?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
What is it?
Wish I knew why.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Yes, Alan.
Listen...the Heart.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Looks like somebody declared war.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Yes, there is.
That's it...
Then don't drift down further.
Can I see your license and registration please?
What?
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
...Blood has been shed.
Oh, geez.
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
How ya doin'?
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Just a general way.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Can you be any more specific?
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Huh? Yah?
What... What is it all about?
...Brainerd?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
...Is everything okay?
I mean a parking lot.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Hiya, Lou.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
No, I didn't...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Nope.
Oh. Oh, my.
We've got a -
Yah?
He was killed in action.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Who do you think could've done this?
I'm in pain.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
You can't have the whole brain!
Looks like this is goodbye.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
What... ?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Here.
You feel nothing?
I could check your prostate.
Guy or girl?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
We did make love?
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
What do you want me to do?
Well, uh... great.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
What car?
Doesn't matter.
Any historical figure.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Yes, I promise.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I want to know --
Why do people think I'm you?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You have jobs.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
I'm not going...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Please...
Not exactly according to plan.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
What have you left for me?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
What?
Maintenance.
Very good, Sir.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
There is no money.
Yes, it is.
What are you doing?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
What list?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
You have to tell us now.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What did you see?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
This is cheery.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What is it?  What are you?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Right. April 25th.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Carter, get out!
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Ninety.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
This place is a trip.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You never been in one of those things.
Gawd, you look awful.
Can you handle the door gun?
Where did you find this clown?
We just take pictures?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Hello, John.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
No, I'm fine... really...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
The moron?
My agent.  I called my agent.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
You a friend of Parry's?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
No... thanks... Listen --
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Parry.
Can I take you to lunch?
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
The Red Knight!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Happily married, probably.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
It sounds exciting.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
There isn't any more to tell.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Cerveza.
You just going to sit there?
I'm going on over there...
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
No.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Rayette.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Washington.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
What?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where's Catherine?!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
Serious, that's what's important to you?
That's what you said?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Just give me a chance, will you?
That'll make you happy.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
That's an old maid's tale.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Victor.
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
A play-ya.
You look good.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
How you treat them?
She fucks it all up!
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Wha'?
Yeah.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Unbelievable.
You're kidding.
Hey you're really nuts.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Full name.
It was planted on me, sir.
You can't keep me here.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
So what do you figure?
Okay. Some idea.
Fletch...
What, the heat here?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Here you are, Doctor.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I guess not.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Where are you going?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yo!
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John who?
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Are you still in love with Alan?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I'll take you to a game.
No.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
You want I set up?
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
I'm her cousin.
Uh, almost.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I'd say charcoal.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Not really?
Frieda's boss.
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
My axe!
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
So, did you find my dad?
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Jazz, we're talking here.
You're that guy, the private eye.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Well try, okay?
What's your name, asshole?
What?
No... yeah...
Did you pick up the car?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What's your story?
What's he do?
Who stuck up the laundromat?
You got the warrant?
You want the red or the white?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You remember Mary Finelli?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Switches are shorted out.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
You ready?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What's going on?
What are you talking about?
Fire.
Chief?!  Is that you?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
Whatta we do now?
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
Yeah, I think so...
John, he's got my driver's license.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
How you feeling?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She makes ten.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
So how are things at the hospital?
So how'd you like LION KING?
You work too hard, John.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Who are you?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
What was that?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Your bed.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Somebody was in here.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Daddy, what is going on?
No.  No, it's not...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
So what happened?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Does he know about what happened?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Okay.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
I know what it sounds like.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
Did you hear that?
What are you doing??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
He is not.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
I...I can't...
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
What is your location?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
What did you find?
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Asbestos lining.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
What happened eighteen months ago?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What?
Had to be him.
Great game.
This could be it.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
What?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
We must have been heroic.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
What do you want me to do?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
What am I doing?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Why do you care?
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Have to hurry back.
Why?
I was educated by nuns.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little drastic maybe?
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
He's a very sweet man.
No one's waiting.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
God gave you ten thumbs.
I'm sorry.
Hm.  Is it?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
All right. Fine.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
I like football.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
That's the last.
Where do we start?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
It's about the Director.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Suit yourself.
I have to know where you come from.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
It's okay, Eugene.
They found my eyelash.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Yes.
My medication.  I left it back there.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
All it takes is a long arm.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Where did you get them developed?
After four years and now the question comes up.
How was it?
I couldn't have... much longer.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
There are three men dead.
I don't want to go there.
I can handle it.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Where are you going?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
No more about Beynon.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
I don't know.
Where?
How's Mama and the kids?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
You knew what I'd do.
Yeah.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Yes.
Why?
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
Really.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes.
Really?
You sure about that?
You've been watching the film.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
No.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
You all right now?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
What?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
That's what I was wondering.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
No. Really, I am.
You sod.
Are you awake?
What you going to do?
Is he?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Eh? Have a drink.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
I have to. Things to see to.
They do that up North.
Ask me?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
All right. Two hundred.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
It's not.
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
They...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
What do you mean?
As a robbery.
You didn't?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
A buck a shot.
I'm sorry?
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Can we get some coffee...?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Everything I...you know...
A waste of time?  Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Where were you?
You understand?
Who used to say that?
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Mmm.
Excuse me, fella.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Roma.
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Murray...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
The leads are assigned randomly...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Why?
What happened?
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Why I don't...
What are you talking about?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Why?
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Uh...
Oh!  For the magazine...
You're sure?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
Yes.
What do I...?
Yes.
Monday.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
I told you.
What's going on here?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
I can't regotiate.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
This.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
They didn't get my contracts.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Three?  I count two.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
No, where is it?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
What if we don't pay?
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Not for strangers; for my country.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
It was hard to have him killed.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
What is it?  Can I help?
Beautiful.
Why?
Am I a prisoner?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Will you tell him?
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
If you need anything, just...
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Fifteen percent skim?
What's up?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
What the hell are you talking about?
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
This meeting is adjourned.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Sleeping inside me.
Why don't you sit down?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You're a considerate young man.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
The money was sent.
Not good.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
You were unfair with them.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
I thought we would meet alone.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
What if I say shove it?
What about Michael Corleone?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
What's that mean?
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
You did not know?
No!
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
What's to sketch?
You went to university?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
So you had a wife?
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Sorry.  Not today.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
What was that about?
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Do I have any other choice?
Is that --?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
What happened?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
So it is going to happen after all.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
You only embarrass yourself.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
Mr....Kay?
You didn't?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
My monsters?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
What about?
I think about that night a lot...
I'm not interested --
How is he?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
No...
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I'm on the move -
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Where you been, anyway?
What's the matter?
Donny --
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Why didn't you tell me?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Any more, O -- ?
Yeah... You want a ride...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Cool. So you're living up North?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
What?
Toby...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Call 911 -
A distinction worth noting ...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Let me worry about The Club ...
No worries ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Hello, Otto ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
You need him...
Who's "Eleanor?"
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
Not really -
Billy, how are you?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Wha?  Me?
Nods again.
Anybody!  You understand?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I'm in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
Jezuz Christ!
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Where's the stuff?
You know. The stuff I left.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Watch this.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
I got dry cleaning.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
No way! You're kiddin'!
Who's she talking to?
Who'd you call?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Thanks, Chuck.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
How'd you know where to find me?
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Somethin's in my room.
No students work for me.
Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
Okay. How?
--Half-red, half-black--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Sean.
Hello.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
I don't know. India maybe.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What do you want to do?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
That's very presumptuous.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Probably not.
Nautilus?
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
What does?
Watch your mouth.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
When did you know she was the one?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
See ya.
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
What?
No.
I have twelve big brothers.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Well...
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Fine.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Just for fun?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Will? Are you awake?
At least you have a mother.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Ready, Pa?
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Ready, Ma?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Two.
Two.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
Government.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
That cut you got?
Why, you're the preacher!
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Excuse me for asking.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Is it fur?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Get to what?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Yeah.
I never asked you!
How 'bout Granma?
Where you going?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
No'm.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Know where we're a-goin'?
Don't taste bad.
Granma's dead.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
But who done it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
What's this?
Morning.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You're so funny...
What?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Not much else.
Are you going to the reunion?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
Bad people.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Jesus Christ!
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Up on the right.
Like a union?
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
One cannot love and kill.
Throw that away.
This?
They blame you for the compromise.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
How are you? How's business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
The answer's no.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
It is. It's lovely.
You missed a button.
Yeah?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
What?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Did he tell you that?
You got everything you need?
I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Yeah, you know everything!!
What did you say?
Who is it?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
What do you mean?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
It's so cruel.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Good luck to you, Annie.
- See, what you can do for him --...
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Don't you go to school?
Why do you always wear that hat?
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I can't... not yet...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
Jude, you okay?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Well, that'll happen.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Talk to me.
How did you know that?
Two days.
That's a nice score for a girl.
It's too much machine for you.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
We need your help.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Colonel who?
Die, dickweeds!
What? whatwhatwhat?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
A hacker planted the virus.
What the hell was that all about?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
When did you find this out?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Not without Jamie.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I thought you said you were ready.
Then we'll be safe?
You don't believe that do you?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
Where's the radio?
Why didn't you wait for me?
Sure.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
He was standing right here.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
He was watching me.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Just answer the damn phone.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Jesus!
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
They could be.
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
There's nothing else I can do.
I couldn't if I tried.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
...any sister talk?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
You want to see some?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
We could...we could do that.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
And it's just in one ear?
Like what?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
How ya doin', man?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Well, are...are they big?
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Uh, yes!
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
I thought you weren't coming.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Mm-hm?
Where're you going?
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know.
Are you angry with me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
I am... I did slave all day.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Are you sure?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I know...I know.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
This is the second opinion.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
Okay, okay.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Yeah, can you believe it?
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I remember you.
I recall you.
I'd never do that.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Really?
Oh.  Oh.
You're okay, though, huh?
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Yeah.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
When'd you get here?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Oh...
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
I have not read you your rights.
...how are things at the Hospital?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
We could skip the Gavotte.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
Seen what, sir..?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
And how would you know that?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...unmarked hundreds....
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
I'm an orphan.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
...long overdue.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
You were given backup....
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Fine, thank you, but
"Because we don't have any money."
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Thank you.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
Then tell me.
Then what brings you back?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Mine!
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
That would be a No.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
What are you doing?
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Hey.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Fuck off.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
It's not my style, okay?
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't know. Should you?
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
It doesn't work on small animals!
Did not.
If you'll excuse me......
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
What's that?
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Who cares!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Fruit.
She's terribly hurt . . .
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Poor Father . . .
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
No.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
GWEN?
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Uh... eighty two?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Last week...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Often, uh.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
I... I know that, John...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Helluva story!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
What's "cynical"?
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
-- institution.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, that was easy.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Here, take this out to the table.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
And it's a shorter commute.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
All new houses have noises.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
What about cable?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Neil, do you mind?
Is it a king or a queen?
Lieutenant?
Anything from the bank?
What?
She was a good woman.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
I cannot explain.
Huge.
Corpses?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Then who's Russell Nash?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Where will you go now?
Be careful, Conner.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Fine.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Not if they're looking at something else.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
We been through that.  Forget it.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
I got the gasoline --
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Shh, they'll hear you!
You gotta pee?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Is something wrong with Jane?
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Where are my children?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Who are you?
What do you want?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
We, who is we?
Who are you?
How many in your family?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
When?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You think they will believe you?
Business is good at the hotel?
Let's go.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Great, I really need a shower.
Where are we going, sir?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
He wants your wisdom.
I couldn't help.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
What is it, Paul.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Has Roger spoken yet?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
What do we do with all these people?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Thank you, sir.
Paul. Are you alright?
Out? Where are you going?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
And what's Steven's status?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- bullshit --
Melissa!
What?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
I don't think so...
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Good point.
What are you looking for?
Price!!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
You think this is fucking funny??
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Fascinated.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Town records are coming up now.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
My angel!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
You didn't think much about that before.
God rest her soul.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
What are you talking about?
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
You're bleeding.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
How long will it take!
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something through that wall!
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Uh-huh?
What?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
I'm trying to quit.
Taken what?
I'll do it!
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
What am I looking for?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
What ... What ... ?
But how in God's name ...
JP?
You're apologizing?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah right.  Look ...
Something like that.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Catholic girls are scary...
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Don't be stupid...they...
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Sharp.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
...Hello?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
What a beautiful thought.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Terrific.
Terrific.
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But, Buzz --
And Sid says you stole it!
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
But, sir! --
Not that way! Through the door!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Ya get the special?
Maybe he's wise.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
You don't believe in it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Mrs. Rand.
You're single?
Is she a doctor?
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
Well?
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
What do you think?
So early?
I... I think I am...
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
What's for dessert?
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You okay?
Mikey Williams?
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
It's really quite all right.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
You ask what the point is?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Jesus, Jim!
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Just be careful.
No!
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
I don't ever want to see you.
When worlds collide.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Can I come?
Her name's Libbets.
And?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Yeah.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
So far.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
You did your homework, Officer.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
We already did.
Yeah.  All over.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
That's right.
Did she?
Randy Stetz?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
One of your cases?
Best friend?
You and Kay were like sisters?
She wouldn't tell me!
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
Down at the station?
But you wanted to.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I couldn't prevent it.
And if I cut my hair again?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Claudia - don't -
You both did it?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You know her?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
Come, you're going to feed now.
Dear God, what have I done?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
I don't pretend to know.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
NO!!!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
That's all past, Lestat.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
Well, what a lucky break for me.
But why did you tell her?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
But it has. There is no more to tell.
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
What can I do for you?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
What are you doing in my closet?
Hello? Hello?
Don't even think about it.
Karla!
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Yeah.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Deep breaths --
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
...Why?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Oooh, the mainland --
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
To a great weekend --
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
What's going on?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What an odd question!
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Your daughter is ill.
This girl --
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
How did she die?
Listen to what I say --
Theodosia --
He hates all my race.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Yeah, very funny.
Go through with what?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Well, naturally. Of course.
What did you stop it for?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Thank you very much.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Want to give my flower a drink.
It will?
Daddy!
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Hee-haw!
She's swell.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Nice girl, Mary.
Well then, how do you know?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Oh, George!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Violet Bick!
Hello.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
All of it?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
I'd like to do that.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Too young or too old?
In that place?
Oh, no.
I'll take it. And then what?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Didn't you tell her?
Where'd you get that dress?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Huh?
You forgot something.
No.
Why'd they decide to move?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Where to?
Do I have to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Yeah?
Did you get any pictures?
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Listen -- what are you doing later?
It's good with coffee.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Nothing.
All summer?
What'd I say?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
That's it?
When?
They made me go with them.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
What's that mean?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
What about the others?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Take me.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
My imagination isn't that good.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Where are you going?
Up.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
What's that?
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
... He ought to put him in here.
I have to get out of here.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Go where?
Fine.  Have them do some.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
No!
Afraid I can't do that.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
'Course they're also so rich.
Sure am.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Did you see that?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Make sure you put this back.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Five hundred yards.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Like mother, like son....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
Dad died from a heart attack....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
What happened?
I wish there was something I could do....
Let me speak to Ellen....
How many...?
What happened to Clarence and...?
When I signed on....
We got it together, Jake....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
'Snuck up on me....'
You told me what?
Your equipment has crapped out again....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Yes.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Why?
I'm asking it.
I'm going up to the institute.
Where's your watch?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Three or four.
Once.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
No .. But we have a theory ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.
Have you been here long?
Are you wearing a uniform?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You think he still loves her?
Who told you?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh Jerry.
You think so?
Wonder what he said.
We are?
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Oh my God.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Well.
You don't have to explain.
What?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
He's coming over.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
You don't want to go home, do you?
No, you're --
Not everyone has what you have.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, tell the story.
Gorgeous.
How sad --
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
You said "fuck".
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
What?
You hate to swim.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
I thought you were an expert.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
You rented an automated litter box.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Found this, but the battery's dead.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
But then you never get to go in space.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
That's hard to believe.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
What?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You version of it.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Their what?
No.
Lava?
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
What's that?
So that others would know about this place?
Are you insane?!
You think this is all a joke?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
How many lines of code are there?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Anything else, you old fossil?
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Do you see anything?
No. We can't.
Why not?
He sends his apologies.
In a box under my seat.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You want to talk about this?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Where does he think he's going?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
What's that?
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Thanks for the presents.
What?
You want to put in chain saws?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
He's fucking nuts.
Oh?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
None of that's true?
Oh?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
What's that?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
What happened? Where's Jason?
Yes -- we do.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
An empty tomb?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
A true friend would do it.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You're just doing your job.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Well, I --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
You don't believe that.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Eight -- and seven months.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
Do you?
That's <u>mad</u>.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Ludwig.
Women are all you have on your mind!
This is filed incorrectly!
It's ... lovely.
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Enjoy.  Well --
I'd just be guessing.
Don't belong?
You think people hate you.
What was better? I made better bait?
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
What about?
You said that.
Why?
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Most of them.
Well do you think it was him?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
No.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Well --
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Thanks.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Please.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Is that all you have to say?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
What?
Well there's a couple --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
I can't follow you.
Well --
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Well?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
On earth.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
Wow!  French toast, really?
You get a new fence.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Is this really your desk?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Who will read me my stories?
Objection!
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Objection!
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Six years.
I consider it less my failure than his.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Joanna, what the hell is--
I don't know, Jim...
Yes, what?
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
No.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
You're sure?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Thelma, if I die--
All quiet?
Goodbye, Kundun.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Do I have money?
Where is Alsace?
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
I will not go.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Please, come in, so cold.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Me?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
The Chinese.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
We have.
You have grown up very good.
I do.
We cannot.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
It happens when I land.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
And you like me.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Then do it!!
Bastard bit my chopper.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Right.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Never been to Maine before?
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Baby crocs?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
He thinks they're what?
Good.  See ya soon.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
I'm not mushing it.
Alright, Jack!
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
I'm ready when you are.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Thanks for your help.
Is the dead guy in there?
Not yet.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
You have a thing against museums?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You threw it at me!!
You think Jack's handsome?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Hank?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
<u>Kelly</u>--
Kelly--
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
"- every day."
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Miggs has been murdered.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
What would it take?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Starling -
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
It's much better than your shoes.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Why so briefly?
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Can we rest soon?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Why didn't you bury those people?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
What is it?
And my compliments to you...
You still have an aversion to the water?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
And if we're unlucky?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Yes.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
My colors?
You mind if I take a look at this?
Was there such a thing?
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
They know, don't they?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Okay, number 23's full.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
You got money in this tub?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Personal effects...
Who cares?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
What's that?
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Can I help?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
What are you doing?
Is he on his own?
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Where?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
You what? What are you on about?
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
I will.
I want your bar.
And?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
What have you come as?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Six.
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Oh, come on, Amado--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
--you're going to be on your own.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
The--the officers.
Why don't you start with that?
Out of the Army?
We're not running a dating service here.
Charley Wade.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Just wondering.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Yeah, well--
Same weight I always was.
350 pounds.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
My mother said he never asked about--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Homework?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Made some money, came back here--
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
It's a lead mine.
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
You could take it--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Treasure hunter?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
That where he was shot?
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
And people make their choice--
Why would you want to do that?
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
Right.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
The Sheriff.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
And when my father was Sheriff?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Of course you can.
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
So I've heard--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Pilar--
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
You sell much out here?
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
You know who it was?
Otis what?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Thirty-five bucks.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Hokey enough for you?
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
Yes.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
When do you want me to start?
He's good.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Oh Christ.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
What then?
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer--
Are you all right?
Harry?
I've got to help him.
What about me?
Bad show last night?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Mr. D'Amour?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Leave her alone --
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
The Puritan?
That.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I did it for Dorothea.
You didn't try hard enough.
What about Philip Swann?
Is he the Puritan?
And?
You could still help me do that.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Bob, it's me.
Ok.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
I don't want to go home.
It's Charlotte.
Of course.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
I don't remember.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Charlotte?
Yes.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
I don't think so.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Is this a bad time?
Is there anything I can do?
What?
It's ok.
What?
Like popcorn?
Yeah.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
I missed you.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
It's nothing.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You killed my parents.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
You just call?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
And the point is?
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
You okay?
What's the bible for?
Maya?  What do you mean?
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
He could see me.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Ah, Mom.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
How is he?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
There you go.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You're a caterer?
Coach...
What?
That was nice.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Hello.
Damn, girl.
Nah.
A horse?
No.
He's in college?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
So?
A ride home.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Would you watch the damn road?
You don't look half-bad.
Four.
I can't be nice to a fan?
What are we playing for?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
She understands.
Quincy...
he's just playing, Q...
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Cheap date.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Then why are you so upset?
We should head over.
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Not great.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
You work too hard, Pop.
We need to talk.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
From your mouth.
Came by to check on you.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Good.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
It was scary though.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Who was it?
What are you lookin' for?
got some coffee brewing, huh?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
If you're not here for a 422 --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Please, yes.
Great, bye.
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
Yes.
What's your name?
Claudia.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I want a shot of tequila too.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
I don't know.
Son, don't --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I'm almost done.
Did you listen to me?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
You see?
-- memory?
Yeah.
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
It's all important --
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
What name?  My name?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
...ok...
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
You on any medication?
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
I need you to get me Paula --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I love you.
I don't think I want that.
It'll take the pain away.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Do you know the answer to this?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
But you can't say....
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Yeah.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
That's it.
You're late, not me.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Alright.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
What had you to do with this, Mother?
No, Louis!  No!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
It can.  I know the way.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Who does?
But -- are you sure?
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
D'Artagnan!
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Raoul... is in love...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What's this?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
No...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
1490...Breckinridge...
I knew I could count on you.
I'm not going anywhere!
You must be going somewhere.
I'm stranded out here.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
I have to.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
Get me a plane!
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
'Changes?'
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
He went to the men's room.
Not yet.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Is that you. D?
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I don't know...
Yes.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Yeah...
No. I can help you.
Do you know something about that?
Most people are.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
To do what?
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Do you remember what you said?
What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Maybe we should give it some time...
Yes. Is Molly there?
Will it keep them out?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
How did it happen?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Stuart is fine.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
What disadvantage?
Yes.
I don't have one right now.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Why does it feel good?
Yes.
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
You have to do it.
I refuse.
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
What was that all about?
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi... am I late?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
We had a deal!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Can I help you with something?
So your name's not Gorsky.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
A -- a tourist.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
If you get caught using that --
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You don't, do you?
Did you hear that?
He had an accident.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Give me your phone.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Why do my eyes hurt?
For what?
Yeah.
She would say she knows enough.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do you believe in?
Hello?
Hello, Neo.
I just thought... you were a guy.
How did you do that?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
What are you doing?
Do what?
It's a city?
How?
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Neo!
No, all we got is $40.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Panther...
Next time, bet with your own kind.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Back so soon.
That bad, huh?
You getting out too?
How much?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Oh...around...why?
What do they expect you to say?
Anything specific?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Sure...He lives there?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
The girls like it loud.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
I know...I know.
You could say that.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Have you got a minute?
I hate parties --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
I don't like cake.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Yes, sir?
-- Did I hear 'business'?
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Hot or cold.
Yes.
Perhaps you could remind me.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
As close as a deal could be.
Shall we adjourn?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Yours.
That's it?
Don't you want to hear the details?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
And what do I get?
'It's up to Joe'?
Make it go 'way.
Yah.
She knows you real self?
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
You love Allison, don't you?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Susan?
Watch me do what?
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I mean I appreciate that.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.
Why?
Girlfriend?
...No.
But there's so much to tell you --
Will it?
I'm still here.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
How long have I got?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Not at all.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
I'm not everybody.
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Excellent.  What is it?
Uh-huh.
Why didn't you stop me?
Okay.
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello, Bill.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
No.
I told you to shut up.
You are --?
Yes.
Of course.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
'Take me'...?  Where?
Time.
I'm sorry --
What question?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Drew told me.
Don't get carried away.
That's all?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Then what will you say?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I love him.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
Did I say something wrong?
21.
30.
Well, what then?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Who did this to you?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Thanks.
Yeah, I remember you.
I don't want blood on them.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
What?
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
Neither do I.
I'm not.
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
How do you know about me?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Shut your mouth!
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
John Gammell?
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Who?
You're living.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Who the fuck are you?
Prove it.
Like what?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
It makes all the difference.					 *
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
We know these people...!
I was the kids' godfather.
Sure.
How many?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Where would I go?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
You afraid of violence?
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
Yeah?
What friend?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Where we meeting 'em...?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Hey, fuck him.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
What are you talking about?
Have faith.
On the phone.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
What do you care?
This the load you lost a while back?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
What's in your socks?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
And what?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Two kilos.
How's your hernia?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where'd you get that limp?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Sixty Lira?
I'll pay extra
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Yes.  I think so.
But just...
He wasn't even in the car?
Yeah.
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
My passport!
His name?
Hey, you can't...
Lady...
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Weird shit...?
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Its muscles are locked.
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
I pull.
Which way?
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
What-
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
My God.
I'm not much of a critic.
Sure.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
Pretty rough so far.
Then the roads are open...
The phones are working?
I guess that means it's okay.
I'm...
Perfect.
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Set what up?
I want my pills NOW!
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
You really think so?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Be my guest.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Stop--stop right here.
That's nice.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Did they win?
You picked another winner!
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Where?
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
And the check's in the mall.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- right..where is it?
- torque wrench.
I wouldn't do that.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Care to wait a decent interval?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
How do you suggest I go about it?
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You mean it'll be difficult.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I believe that's right.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Something else?
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
She must still be on the property.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Only four more cars.
I'm walking.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
The message is for Job.
I didn't say that.
We did what we had to do.
What happened?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
What?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
What was your deal with Job?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
I guess.
Why not?
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Whatís going to make him do that?
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
You got it.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Loud and clear.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
What?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You haven't said anything.
Bed.
What's your news?
It's temporary.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why?
This is good. Uhh...
Where'd Johnny find you?
I'm a wolf?
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Me neither.
That light.
Oh my God.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
For what?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
He didn't come!
This is your place.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
No.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Have Something.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Who is he?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
What?
No.
No.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What about the moon?
No.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Don't fight.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Have you come to make peace with me?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Then why are you eating alone?
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
Yes!
...What?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Well, who is your lord?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Of course.
And not too expensive.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
I'm invincible!
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
What?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
Too late.
What?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
The nose?
He will be soon. He's very ill.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Blue.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Bring out your dead!
Farewell, Concorde!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Father, lad.
How?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No.  It's unhealthy.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
Well ... yes ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
The good-looking one.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
You know nothing about her!
Good man.  And is she all right?
Yeah.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
They aren't as watchful as you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
I am told so.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Is that not enough?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
We're going to lose.
Cold is good!
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
I have no idea.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Why is he not here?
What's the riddle?
How the hell did you do that?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Maybe he's not dead.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
I came from the city on the left.
I have to talk to you.
Happy?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Our time's up.
I'm okay.
So how do I start?
What did you say?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
You gotta be kidding?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
One.
It will work out.
Wow!
You're really something Coco...thank you.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
My name is Rita.
Hi.
What?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
No.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
Mulholland Drive?
There's nothing?
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
No, we don't.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Betty Elms.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
Find out who they are?
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Is that it ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Now where do we go ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Not listening !
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
I wanted to let his family know....
Where are we going ?
What was that ?
That's a shame.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Not yet.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
No I am not.
What was that ?
Was that the Old Man ?
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
Thank you.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Really ? On a date ?
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
What now ?
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Good morning.
Good morning.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
THANK YOU.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Was it a nice funeral?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
I don't know if I want to.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I told you it was a long story.
What's the matter?
Is it okay if I drink this?
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Then I have come to the right place.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Woah, watch it!
DON'T!!!
What's he smoking?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Ten bucks.
Wow!
No problem.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Committed?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
I should do this myself.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Hi!
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, sure okay.
Is there milk in them already?
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Shelly?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I'm impressed.
Ex...ex, ex...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I need the job.
Uh huh?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Dance with me?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Of course not.
Are they ready yet?
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Why?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Hi, is Vada home?
Thirty five dollars.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Oh, Vada...
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Probably.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Can we look around in your camper?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I like my name.
NO!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I think it should be outlawed.
Thomas J?
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Uh huh.
No.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
But, I don't know how.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
What?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
You think...
I have a suggestion...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Someday she'll thank you.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Ju...
Exactly.
Exactly what?
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
It doesn't say th...
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You miss her, huh?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Will she like it?
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Oh, yeah.
... your one chance for true happiness?
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
And to m...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
I hate that music.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Whose?
Howdy.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
Replacement party.
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When I was little, in church.
I'm here.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Well...
Hello.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
We just got a gold record.
You always live there?
I know a couple.
Ah... Peter Finch.
You want a ride into town?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Susanville, Soledade.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Manson beat you.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Describe Mallory.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They've hypnotized the nation.
Just for fun, I guess.
That's my opinion.
You can't be serious?
What's the travelling arrangements?
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Yeah, sure.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
When do you want the assembly?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I see.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Yeah.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Want to keep your job, boy?
I know.
People seen him 'round.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Yeah, I been there.
You working?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Why did you?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Four.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Thank you.
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Am I as good as they?
Uh-huh. Why?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
I keep thinking about him.
Yeah!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
There's nothing to say.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Who're you?
What's on your mind?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come back some other time, will you?
No thanks, Lee.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
'Musta knocked her up.
Come on, Will.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Dixie McCoy
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Jah guides us.
Right...
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
What are you talkin' about?
How's the ice break?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I had to limit your options.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
What is it?
I'm going in.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Case... it's four a.m.
Like what?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
You're Pam?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
What is this?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
God, I can't do this.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
wasn't even thinking about-
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Thank you.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
We followed your instructions.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
We're here!  You sent for us!
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Help me with this thing!
Oh, please...
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
What are you doing here?
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You know her?
I think it's sad...
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What's all this.
Here.
Yeah?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Huh?
All of them.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I'm sure you would.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
I gotta stay up, Max.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
I used to live in this house.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
So?
What?
Max, where's Kristen?
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Ms. Thompson.
Never been here before?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's what I know.
Doesn't matter.
Remember -- open mind.
Who would know where they were hidden?
And what are they?
Science...I suppose.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh -- Okay.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
I thought you were leaving.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Yes, you did.
I'm sorry.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Who was Gilda?
What?
Undressed like this, yes.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Excuse me?
Okay.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
And we intend to use them!
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
No, it doesn't.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Maybe.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Excuse me.
Bad news.
What?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Yes, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Is there anything else?
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
On this ward?
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
That's it! We made it!
Welcome back.
I hope everything is settled.
What's your name, buddy?
Yeah, kid?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
No.
Ca-na-da...
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
There they are!
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Lobotomy!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
Okay, Harding, you're on.
So why are you talking to him?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I refuse!
No!
Yeah, Mac?
I wanna go home!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
He's not!
Poker!
Doc, what can I tell ya?
How are you feeling?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
I'm afraid not.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
You think it's funny, huh?
Somebody's coming!
Got a cigarette?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
You know, I never got your name.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Now you talkin'.
He's dead.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Your grandmother?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
What for?
What?...
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Oh no.  Do you?
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Congratulations.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Why not?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Please.  I need to know.
Nice dress.
What are you doing here?
So were you.
You okay?
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
I can't believe you did that!
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
I was hoping for the real thing.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Wait.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
Is he married?
Is he gay?
So?...
What's he do?
Yes you did.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Is that bad?...
But it's July.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Thank you so much.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Oh my God.  Where?
Is he looking at us?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
What?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
What if he doesn't like me?
Maybe I can change him.
Yes.  He is.
And you are?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
That was the idea.
Mm—hmm.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
Father Barry.
What happened?  What happened?
Which side are you with?
You training to be a nun or something?
What?
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Wham... .
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
It's true.
I just told the Father.
You... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
My hand.
Edie...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Jimmy...
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Good luck.
You can!
What do you think?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Give me a double.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Count this.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
You got some nerve.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Look!
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
For what!?!
They are live ones?
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
Did you know that when you married him?
You're good.
You were his what, his box?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Oh, man.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You tell your sister about it?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
You know how I felt about her.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Is that what you would've done?
Shut up.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You get the key?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Why you think is today?
Who was the friend?
I'll need a last known address.
There a problem, Foley?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I don't think we should get into that.
You're not dumb.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Have they got Midge up there?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Can I do what?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
How you know that?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
It's a --
Can we change the subject?
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
You gonna go get him?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Ten gees.
I found a rubber.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
You're Walker, right?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
How could you do this?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
We gotta face some facts here.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
You hear my okay?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Our doctor's gone too.
Danny's not coming?
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
I can't. It's all too much.
It's that jerk Walter.
That's disgusting!
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Looking good out there.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
I thought you were...for a while.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
I'd love to.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
Thank God for that.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Does everybody have to hear?
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
But accidents can happen.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Yes... why?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Is this a good spot?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Jesus.
Bob...
Why, Beckett?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not ready to die.
Ready for what, baby?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
I buy that.
Rayisha.
Not bad.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
I suppose you could say that.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
No.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Some do. I didn't.
That's right.
Answer the question, please.
Hello?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Mom?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Aren't you?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Back to the ship, huh?
One or two.
You sure you can keep --
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
But they...they could still be....
Like the light is scalding it.
Possibly.
Hey, who?
S'matter?
60 years ago.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Smoke screen for what?
What, you're goin' off, too?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
New Mecca....
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
"God is Great," yes?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
...then we saw this.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
The blood transfusion.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Well, maybe they're not.
Got your sensors?
long pause) You know it.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Scarecrows?
Zira doesn't want your female.
Gorilla hunters ...
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Read it yourself.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Bunker...
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Says he can't walk.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Youse so fucked up man.
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Taylor! Francis!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
No, thanks...
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
What are you talking about! 
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Would you mind?
How careful should I be?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Want to dance?
Us?
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
No.  I paid him off.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
We try to be decent.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Name it.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
What?
Could be.
How are you two getting along?
I wouldn't know.
Information.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Mitchell was too drunk.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
He saw my face too.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Such as?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
I never saw it before.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Not if it clears the air.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Nice.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
What does it look like?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Hello.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Very thoughtful.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I haven't really thought about it.
To the airlift.
To the Fleet.
Oh yes.
Let me see.
Ha ha...
That's enough of that.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
Why not sit down and wait?
Not bad.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
No.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Friends of yours, huh?
Where?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You gonna pull?
I can't do this.
Babes.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Aw shit.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
What do you want?
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
Mmmnnn...?
Hawkins?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
We can reach an understanding on this.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Stolen?
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Fine.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
What?
Better believe it.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Can I have some chips?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Mmm, I could tell.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Where'd you learn to do this?
I'm not just talking about sex.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I think you'll approve.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
And that's the way the game is played.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
You always been rich?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What's that?
You won't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
What did you do to him?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Did I wake you?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
What!?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Who did you think?
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Rent.  You're late.
Niece?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Will I like it?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Are you looking for something in particular?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
My Westley will always come for me.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I killed him myself.
You mock my pain!
... as ... you ... wish...
Singed a bit, were you?
Did you say, "I do"?
Faster!
I thought I was going faster.
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than ten.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Yes.
Okay.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
-- anything you want --
He's already dead.
Hah?
Sixty-five.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
He's dead. He can't talk.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Who are you?!
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
Go in, get after her!
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Mr. Bialystock ...
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
I'm not going to jump on you!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Maybe you're happy.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Liebkind, no!
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Really, I never dreamed ...
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
Not.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on.  Let's get going.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
We can't play today?
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
What do you do best?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
You out to buy a motel?
No. At least I don't recall.
Tell me all about her.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
How did she pay you?
What?
And when she left, she never came back.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Anyone at home?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Of course not. Please.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
What's the matter?
What do you know about it?
What thing?
I ought to call the police right now!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Just wait here?
Sam.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Who's he?
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
This is the old highway.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I can come down next week.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam! No!
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
You go out... with friends?
I'd like to, but...
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there?
I'm sorry.
We have a problem.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
Do what?
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Well, news of Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What's that?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
No?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
But what about lunch?
Why didn't you eat last night?
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
What do you mean police dog?
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
That's what I said.
I see. Was that all she said?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
To lunch.
What are you laughing at?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
We flopped the first time out.
Dysfunctional --
Well, I got to see her.
I know, Mother.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Am I hurting you?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Okay.
Five hundred rabbits?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, it's not very plain.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
There goes Mother.
He kissed her.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
That's what she would say herself.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
What?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
She will succeed.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Yes, sir.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Yes, I am.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Galley proof.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Gonorrhea?
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Indivisible and inseparable.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
I need the "when" and the "where."
She's fine, as if you cared.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Name one.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
He tried to kill us.
You going rogue on me?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You know... you could say thank you.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Alright?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Yeah.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
As you wish.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
What did he say?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Good shot, Red Two.
There it is!
Oh!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
You promise you won't tell?
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Brad...
You're OK by me.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
What a guy
Goodbye
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
I don't think you're a bum.
I sold them to you.
It's only temporary.
'Bout seven.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Don't like yours neither.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Here -- Three minutes.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
I say ya nothin'!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
That's it? -- Completely?
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
No -- Just me.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
What?
Makes your breath like garbage.
...What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Would you keep goin'?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
He's takin' cheap shots.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I'll do okay.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
What?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
He's a riot.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Hold on a second.
What a gasser.
What's with the dip?
What the hell is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Wrong number?
What the hell are you doin' in there?
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Romeo! Romeo!
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
In love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
He shall be endured
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Hold Daughter!
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
What?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Ay me!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
A most courteous exposition.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Nurse.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
What in bloody hell is going on?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Do I need to repeat myself?
Duty calls?
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
That fucking figures...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Don't do it, Sam!
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
What do you mean?
There's been a slight problem.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
I didn't expect that he would.
So this is what, a test?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You seem one to me.
Gets the job done.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
You should learn a little patience.
As in, they own it?
What's the difference?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
So is the woman.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Not exactly.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You sure your friend got the right place?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
You would have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You better get some sleep, alright?
You slept with her!
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I don't know what you're -
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Well someone's gonna find them.
At the expense of six people.
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
He's going to be trouble.
You're crazy.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
I'm all ears.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
And I'd take it out on him.
How the hell did he find it?
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Test the product?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Have you known this all along?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Lingerie...
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Sure.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
What?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
Hi ma.
How's work?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Well I don't know --
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
How much is that?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
This is your ship?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Yeah, that's right.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
No.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What's wrong?
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Not Yu.  You!
I'm okay, you go.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Gimme the binoculars.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Fine by me.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
What is Mac out?
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Why don't you go get them?
Do you still have the bills?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
OK. Say what it is.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
It was not my intent --
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Oh my god. Griffin.
It's called a dress.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What kind of assignment is that?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Han?
I am so sorry about your men.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes.
See you at the wedding.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Rub your ears.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
You're coming here?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
I'm a work in progress.
Of course.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Yes I do!
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
I hate boats.
But it's on the water.
I love you.
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
That doesn't make any sense.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Right.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
Becky?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Please --
What?
Mom, we already...
Which means --
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It's Y. O. H.
What is it?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
P.  Dad?
What?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
It's only ten o'clock.
No.
God, she's beautiful.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Did not.
Get out.
What if I couldn't get to you?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
Oh.
You're welcome to one.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Got any more ideas?
How goes it?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
This water's cold again.
What's more important than sanitation?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Alone?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
I thought maybe you forgot...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
My kids don't have enough to eat!
What attitude?
Did you see his hair color?
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Why not?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Oh. Hi.
And you admire that?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
Why not?
Really, I don't want to.
Why?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
How you holding up?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Why's that?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You're going to have to explain that one.
Sure, Jimmy.
But...I've seen you.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
Can we talk price?
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Come on, guys ...
Shoot him.
Now get talkin'
You go, boy.
No last name?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
When?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
You've got no choice.
Please ... don't do this ...
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Yeah.  What about him?
The Mexicali Boys
What?!
Jimmy?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
What do you mean?
My sentiments exactly.
What is it, drugs?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
Jackson?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Shut up, will you?
What do you think?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
White-walls?
The men said, nine.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
You get a translator, Captain?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I think you're right, Keith.
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Trust me, you're the best.
Yeah, how so?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Maybe Caen.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Here they come.
Yes, Private.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Lloyd?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
No, no, don't go in there.
Lloyd, it's us.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
You like it?
What are you doing?
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I won?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Goodnight.
Dad.
You're going.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Mom, please?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
No, I read it on the message.
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Whoa.
Thank-you.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
You know what?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
So what's your job this summer?
Today is tomorrow.
Come on.
Be friends?
Yeah.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Well, I need to study, and...
Just my dad.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
You know Diane Court?
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Well, let's find him.
You know what, you'd like her.
Should I stay?
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
What's that?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
God bless you, sir.
Oskar, good of you to come.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Eight hundred, give or take.
They arrived.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
They've broken their pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
What is it?
I'm losing you.
Who is this?
Where is everybody?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
What are you going to do?
What's your subject?
I think he's doing Dolly.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Why?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Who are you?
What do you want from me?
I'm sorry.
I have rehearsal.
What about rehearsal?
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
..this week's TKE kegger...
What's your favorite scary movie?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
I'll be right back.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Who is this?
Thanks.
What kind of a game?
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Oh yeah, how?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
They found another note?
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
You're not a detective.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Just because you knew her?
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Billy? What the...
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
So...
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
I thought you were...
Why did you kill my mother?
Hello?
Who is this?
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
What did you say?
To talk.
How do you know his name?
Come on. It'll be fun.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Sidney's father?
I'll call for backup.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Any word on my Dad?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Drive by patrol.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
What is it? Where's Casey?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Many times.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
What's Leatherface doing here?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Why are they doing this?
No way.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Thanks, Tatum.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
What's so exciting?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Delusions of grandeur.
We would have gotten you eventually.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Drop it.
There's a bucket here.
What?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
It could be nothing.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
What?
I wish I still thought like you.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Sorry about that... I just...
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You know he's fucking us.
What?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Oh... um, William.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
It's a hard place.
Did the wife confess?
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
How's California?
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
How many, would you say?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
JOINT action?
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Talk!
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Why?
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
You ask her!
Nine...  Ten!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
No...She's not...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Where?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Who's that?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
What?
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Thank you, my lady!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Ten pounds.
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
What's the title?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
it will be all right, madam.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
It is all locked safe in here
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Fifty pounds? What for?
I did not.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
Cut round him for now.
And yours?
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Not ready? Where is she?
Be good to her, my lord!
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Will!
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Ay me."
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Who is there?
Oh my lady, my love!
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
I do not love you, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
I . . .
Wait there.
Does she say so?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
Just serve.
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
Finished.
That was good.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Doesn't it worry you?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
But they know.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
What?
Cover it?
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Well, yes.
Cameron?
For the flat.
Who was it?
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Alex.
I'm just looking.
No.
I don't want to. It's different.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
No.
And the money?
You'll wait in the hall?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
I see.
It's OK. There's no problem.
Burglary?
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
No one.
Sorry?
Hello.
What happened to that guy?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
A priest who dies.
I see.
For what?
You know about it?
That sounds fine.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
-- is that right?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Wow.
I don't want to talk about it...
What about?
I hope she's all right.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Then it's not your problem.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
No kidding.
Yeah.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
That you're just like your mother.
Right now?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right, that's right.
I guess not...
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Where do you want to do this?
You would?
... I don't get it done often.
It was after you, baby. After you.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
Baby...
What about it?
No you didn't.
-- oh I thought you were --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Where are you going?
It's too late...
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
There were some shots.
What?
Keep moving --
Do you really mean that?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
I already said hello.
Whether or not I'm going.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Never mind. Where've you been?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Ha, ha.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
That's all you've got to say?
Please!... that's not like you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
George...
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
When?
Sorry, honey, I...
-- yeah?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Why, why do you think that is?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.

No.
Awww --
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Shut the door, shut the door!
Oh yeah?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Don't be silly.
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Egypt?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Well... sure...
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Jill.
No, it's not that...
Have they sat down?
Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Dad?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Maybe he showed me something.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.
Jack...
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Oh,
Please...
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Well how can I repay you?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Delbert Grady.
How?
She eh... interferes.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
No charge?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
What do you want me to do about it?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Yes, I did.
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Stay... stay away!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Have any trouble finding us?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Fine.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
There's something else scary.
You all right, Marty?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
What about crack?  You a user?
But I'm fearful!
How come?  Sister?
What you do?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Oh my! 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
I know.  It's ancient.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
I knew that.
She's a pro.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
You have to help me
Bobs
Experience!  Right?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What? 
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
And the vow of chastity.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
What?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
You saved my life.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
He's a businessman.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Then one day they find you.
Where's who?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But you didn't tell me!
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
I can't see anything in here!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Is this like your old convent?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She's... she's a nun.
Where?
Certainly not.
You must have missed your mark.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Do you have these persons' wills?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm?  See them?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Very few, if any.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I manage fine alone.
Are you familiar with magnets?
It's spectacular.
What is it?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What can we do?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
My God... what has happened?
What... what are you doing... ?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
The church.
Yes, actually.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
You are from the Hollow?
You... you are alive.
He rides tonight.
May I see my mother?
No.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
That boy wants me to.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Can I see him?
I'll see you, Bill.
Did you decide, sir?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Leave.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
You like that Vaughan?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
What are all them books?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
How did your mama die?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Who did you kill?
I thought they was.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Yeah.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
Why?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It was fun, anyhow.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I know he does.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
You walk fast, don't you?
I'll be.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Let's just go, Marsha.
No thank you.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
No! At least I don't think I am!
Better make it charge. 
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
What happened?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
What'll it be, Auggie?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Ready. Any time you are.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You what?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
A little. Not much.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
It'll never be finished.
Does it hurt?
And these?
The refrigerator?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Yeah? Who is it?
Aren't you going to say anything?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
I owe you something.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Mostly what.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I didn't expect to see you again.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Three nights.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Is that your third question?
Now, Mister Gi...
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Closer to eight.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
I have told the truth.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
You think so?
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
What makes you think I play?
White or black?
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Can I say something, here?
Not in those words.
I can't speak for him.
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Beat it, Buster.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
You're welcome.
Hey, Joe!
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You've flipped your wig!
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Fight it.
I got pinched in the elevator.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
And where's he going to be?
What are you doing with my flowers?
I am.
You think he's too old for me?
Security.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Good night, honey.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
What did you say?
What do you think you're doing?
What's that?
I guess she's not in here.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No!
I was it.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Goodbye?
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Why not?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
We got time off for good behavior.
I'll say.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
About what?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
What makes you so sure?
Why?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
What theory?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
It's all right for a bachelor.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
You're flattering me.
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I cut myself shaving.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
You don't owe me no nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
It was such a long time ago.
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Mom, please.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
You heading to the train station?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Hey, man.
Hey, Kat.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
Oh, no.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
What?! No, no. You can’t--
You have more than one gynecologist?
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
So why’d you let him go?
Yeah.
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Yes, sir...
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Goodnight, Daddy...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Yes, David...
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Where did it come from, Mama?
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Any sign of Sounder?
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Hello, David...
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
You ready to eat?
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
What...
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
What?
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Is it Cartman's mom?
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Mph rmpmh rm.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Who are you, kid?
Ber dada!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
MOM!!!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wow!
WHAT?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
I know.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Did you see that, Wendy?
You don't have watches?
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Barnes?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Why can't we?
I don't know what we're facing.
Oh my God.  What happened?
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Take this flare.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
You're not from around here, are you?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
You a mini-golfer?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
What's on your mind, Miles?
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
What the fuck is this?
What's it look like to you?
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
You got a better offer?
No...
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Hello?
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Knock-knock.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Nice set-up.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Line up where you want it.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
What does he do?
No. Do You?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Do I want you?
What's plan B?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
You're here.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I am a professional man.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Who identified the body?
How big is this spacecraft?
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
But you've tested it?
Don't do it, Norman!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Harry's missing.
But sir --
Wait a second --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Going active.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Ted?  Captain?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
I'd also like it noted --
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?
What?  Why...
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
What?
Four days?
You fixed my suit?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Fixing it.
We must've had it delivered then.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
He translated it wrong.
I don't know.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Antibiotic.
Doesn't say.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
What's wrong, Norman?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Well, what's your theory?
For who?  The fish?
Where's it coming from?
C'mon.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
The three of us.
That's right.
Gimme a second --
What does Norman already know?
What is it, Harry?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Do you?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning?
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
The others, sir?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Please, Ted.
The creature?
Well, he's polite.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Four.  Four years --
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
What do you mean?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Are you all right?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Who's the pilot?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Is he afraid of the water?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Are you safe?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
I'm sorry, Carmen.
How do you feel about him now ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
She's flying starships !
You can't walk me home.
How do I know if this is love ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I love you, Carmen.
You don't look very happy to see me.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
That was just a mix up.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
...CUT OFF !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Not a problem.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Yes, sir !
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
You are what...?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Time to impact...?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Viewer ahead.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
We're ready, sir.
Evening, Annie.
Then you'll be wet.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Well, it had sentimental value.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But, but but but...
As the Old Mill goes around...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
Mmm.
...who...?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
What've you got?
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Lookit that, up already.
What is it all about?
What am I gonna do?
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
If I go to jail...?
Ten thousand dollars.
I wasn't doing business.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
...why am I here...?
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Tell it with...
No, you're absolutely r...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
You guys had better leave us a...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I think he's moved...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
We're just talking about the...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I can't do it, Walt.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
What?
...I...
...I know...I know...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
The minute I read that script I said...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Who got their heads cut?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
How about that.
You should.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Grace...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I can't.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
How do they know that, you told them?
No.
I didn't say anything to them.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...
It's lovely.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
That's what I said.
<u>Pay</u> her.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I've got two days to get this house...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Yes, I hear it.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I don't care.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
It just slipped out.
Scream.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
...why do you think?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
I said...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
That's so weak.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No.
But you told us to starve.
I have lava.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I'm worried.
Easy enough.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's a huge moment in their life --
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
What happens next?
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
She was angry at herself.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Oh, my God.
So.  Hopeful.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's just not the right time t...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
And her...?
Looks nice enough to m...
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
That's not us.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
What if he is?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Yes, Mikey?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
This is work.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
My Jesus…
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
Twinkeys!
We used pull.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Fuck!
I dunno.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Hello, Vi.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Say, 'Nigger.'
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Great!
That's too bad.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah, sure.
You know...I like you.
Doubt it.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
How well do you know this place?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
I insist...
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Dissent?
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Don't be ridiculous.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Didn't they tell you?
Yes!
General Schmuck?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
A shooting war!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Who do you think you're talking to?
No, sir.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
You're damned right they are.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I'm trying to, sir.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Naturally I am, sir.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
So am I.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
I said that's the point!
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Take it easy, Major Kong.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
What's it about?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck with what guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, no.
No, he's not with a girl.
Go!
Sure.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Oh, you were in the band?
Am I fucking him?
Buff.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Score! Yeah!
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Mm.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Mm.
What was your name again?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Wow. You did that for me?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
You could've come over.
Was that supposed to be me?
No.
About what?
Hey!
I would've stopped it.
Of course.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
'Bye, Jeff.
You really suck, you know that?
Good, man.
What?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Well, not exactly.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I don't know.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
No, she was just sitting there?!
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Jesus, Jeff.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
And they get caught!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Hi, Jack.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Let me explain something...
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Yeah?
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Really...
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
What has Artie to do with it.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Oh, you --
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Twenty-two.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Get out.
You're a writer, you said.
Who else ?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Haven't got a thing.
How's that about your being my friend?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount studios.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Tell me where I can find her.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
She said it wouldn't last.
Away. From you.
That makes it worse.
Before you go...
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
Finished your estimate?
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Nurse!
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Well...I guess I can't.
Why George, are you proposing?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
What are you making:
You see, a tree is a living thing.
No thanks. You go on.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Where is inner space?
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Why?
You can use the wand.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
Me??
There's a lot of choices here.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
He really was!
Well, aren't you excited?
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
What are you doing?
What kind?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First paycheck?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Man, what is this?
Which country?
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
And do nothing. Just sit there.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
No, we're just going down.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
I thought you'd never get here.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I don't know you, lady.
But the other night...
Gus?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Missing????
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
A normal person.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Lois, I . . .
I'm sorry.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
What else is ballast for?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
I like trees.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It has everything.
Now This I want to hear.
Constantly.
What do you want?
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
General --- ?
I really don't think . . .
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Go on . . .
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
We'll all fry.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Bunkers!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
Mom...
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
I read the article.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Ready?
Don't let me down.
You got wax in your ears?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
He is. Usually.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
Is that real enough for you?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
On radio waves?
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
How are you?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
So there were others?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Hi, Nicole.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why?
I'm not sure.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
You're leaving.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why did you do that, Billy?
And they loved Bear.
From what?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
I did.
What other people?
Excuse me?
You heard what Abbott said?
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
So do you like your new room?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Should I keep reading?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
You seem very sure about that.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
That's not news, Zoe.
Yes.
I tested positive.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Dolores?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
I was scared.
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
What are you up to, Nicole?
No.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Yes.
She'll move away.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Is "he" inside?
See my mother?
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Not being partial, are you?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Get Steve back his job...please...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
But not for anything I did today...
She knows now.
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
What about?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah!
What sort of thing?
Take a top coat.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I didn't do anything!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
I can't
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
No one must follow your work.
My mission is to protect you.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Drive faster.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Easy money!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Out of the way, John!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
They took him from me.
Why attack Russia?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
And no elbows on the table!
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
What's that mean?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You live here, in Berlin?
Three months.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I'm sorry.
What?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What do you think?
You must have a girlfriend.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Just let me go.
You cold?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Bag some Z's?
My whole life has been combat.
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
It's better that way.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Did you play recently?
Clean out your locker.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Please...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
What are you doing here?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
What's wrong?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Nicholas...
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Who's responsible?!
... what... ?
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
I saw them kill him!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Happy Birthday, man.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
Really?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It's different every time.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Drive in.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Your ex-wife.
I don't like her.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
You want company?
You don't believe in the paranormal.
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
What?
Get a blanket!
What do you want?
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
That's where she hanged herself.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
What did it cost?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Jeez.
Theo... Did you?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Is that a problem?
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
Why not?
What kind?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
What?
That would be too easy.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Weren't you on a television series?
Not embarrassed.
Footloose and fancy free.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Who remembers.
Not that I recall.
He alive to see this?
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Eh?
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Ian?
You sure?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Like what.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Is Valentine here?
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
...You don't like the music out there?
Boy.
...I stank, didn't I?
You're an enthusiast.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Huh.
I can get it, yeah.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
All right.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Your place?
...What kind of man *are* you?
Where you going?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
You don't have to--
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
Not guilty, your honor...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Did you make that up?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Hello!
Homicide.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
His eyes are open.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I smell it.  It's here.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
What is it?
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They were yellow!
Stop!
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
I don't understand.
A monster?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
How?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
Where exactly?
<i>A month.</i>
It's the busy season.
That's right.
Cue music...
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Sure she would.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
I've been thinking--
Every time you and Marlon--
What're you doing down here?
I'm sorry, I'm late.
I won't be here Sunday.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
--Darling--
I'll try.
The whole area's being evacuated.
I don't understand.
What do you do?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Special Agent Scully --
You've been back to Dallas?
Who called this meeting?
What's that?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Do I know you?
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Before the bomb went off?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
-- You saw this experiment?
I'm on the roof.
How's that?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
All I told them was the truth.
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
It's like jelly.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah...?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Are we being watched?
Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?
About the conspiracy?
What do you mean, walked?
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
What about you?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Is it cold in here?
What's wrong?
What then?
Agent Novak?
What did you see?
Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Evil.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
That went well.
Thank you.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Is she alright?
What about the cat?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why?
Can I hear you?
It's just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Of course.
Thank you.
You can help us.
I said another man was buried in his place.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Been here long?
When did you see him last?
What are you trying to say?
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
What the devil?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Well?...
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Welcome?
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Unwise, Holly...
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
What do you want me to do?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Coffee.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Vinkel.
Thank you.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
You saw it?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Funny?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Richard. Hi.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
So how many miles do you think it is?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
What about Moliere?
Hi.
Incredible.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They sound like you.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
You're not in school? What do you do?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
What's it about?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
I thought there were people here....
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
And? WHat did you notice?
I don't know. Is that right?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Explain it so I can.
I can't help what I think.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Don't tell me what I --
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Who told you that?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Which one were you aiming at?
This will be a different kind of device.
Oh, what is this shit?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
And what did you do?
Howard Stern.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
The Italian, I presume?
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
The Mamma's there too.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
Then tell him to wax it too.
The medics are looking all over for you.
Is he here?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Great!
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Enzo?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Why?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
What is it?
You were right.
In the lake?
I don't know... why?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
... No?
Hello?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
I didn't dive.
Why?
What?
Johana... New York.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
It's his heartbeat.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Who... Who is that?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Wait!  Professor...?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
It's Esther.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Any sign of Santa?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Okay, what's the information?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
I drink.
Then what do you do?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
It could be a man.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Yes. The lipstick.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Yeah.
Who is he?
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
I know -- Teresa -—
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Have you got a pen?
Are you all right?
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...We’re turning in circles.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
What...?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
I’m calling about the puppies.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yes... Good, good...
Where is the Austrian?
Where is he?
The company. We all work for the company.
What’s the Ambassador?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Carlos De Moraes?
I hope it’s not too significant.
What if it is?
I take it your son is called Leon?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Any friends?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Vous êtes Français?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
Your lady friend did.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
Good reasons?
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
... No.
I know his work better than I know him.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Three...
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
What’s that? A word?
What do you think?
That's a good idea, sire.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, stop it!
Yes...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
Go onto the next question.
I can't read.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Where... where am I?
Really?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Many things...
And may I go to Mass?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Thanks be to God.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Supposing she's an assassin?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Damn right!
And... what does Jeanne think?
No... not like this...
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Do you know how to count?
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
The clothes are not important...
I... submit to Our Lord.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Someone you know?
Hello.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
I haven't seen him.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Pig!
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Where are we going?
Where are you hiding?
What's happening?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Watch your feet!
Like it were a piano?
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
It's my mother's piano.
Oh no, it can't come now.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
You're late.  Where you been?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
You sober?
I picked something up on the way.
I never played for winos.
How'd ya do?
Henry.
Yeh.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
What time you get off work here?
You got a back door to this place?
You move right along, don't ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
Then why the rat?
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
No.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know.  He took it hard.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He was?
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
Nothing.
I can't.
Dorothy!
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Give it to me.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother!
He wouldn't say.
Which way did she fall?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
It's been the same one for three months.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
You can take that out to the car.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'll have to try to remember.
You've been there?
What about this Nunheim?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
He telephoned me today.
About three.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
All right.  All right.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What did you do with the rest?
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Why do you say that?
Pretty girl.
You got types?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Six Martinis.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Yes.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
What are you going to do?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
The suspects!  They won't come.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I don't know.
I hope you're well.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Who fired you?
Turn the car around.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
They stopped.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Not much of a pass.
What about the gold?
Maybe I do.
What happened?
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
Then step aside.
I out rank you, that's why.
Knock it off!
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
There's a way.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Stay low.
Must be a compartment.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Sure.
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
What do you think our chances are?
No!
Don't you touch it.
Well?
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
What do you make of them?
...Wes...?
The...the gold...
But...
Epps?
He's not slowing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Some good ones.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
He says it's a box.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
If!  If there's a treasure.
If there's gold.  If!
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
What the hell are you doing!?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Correct.  Origin?
Drug evasion with....
What did you get?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Then why did you bring it up?
I've never been under the table before.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
no...no, no.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Well?
Not very encouraging.
When?.....How?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I don't know.
She's not there
Where's LUH?
I'm sorry.
Just look at all those people.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
-Where?
How's the print coming?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
What're you talking about?
Only once, at Redstone.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Look, it's a longshot...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Your partner?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Yeah, another round thing.
Right.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Any word?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Alex-
Stay here.
Don't talk.
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I'll do it.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It's our only option.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No.
Amsterdam?
You've never been in Constantinople?
And harems ... ?
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Um-hum!
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
What is it?
Thank you!
Disappointed?
I like you, Baron.
Gaston Monescu.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Two fifty-three, five--
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
And you--
Yes.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Too much blue in crimson.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Ye-es?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Like that!
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Instantly.
You look beautiful.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Yes, madame?
Right!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
The ship will sink.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Shit.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
You told me to change.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
This should be amusing.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Now it's worse.
Will this work?
You jump, I jump, right?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Is your stateroom alright?
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
It's so unfair.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You'll excuse me. 
Guess again, copper.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
How about giving me another coat?
Brett is the name.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I could see you were pining away--
Make it five.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
This is a business trip!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Thank you, sir. 
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
That's too bad.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
She did?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Next month is June.
O.K.! Send that!
Yes--Me--in person!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
So what?
Is that one of the Who's Who?
How much did you lose?
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
I asked where you got him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Come and get him.
Excuse me?
That's the rumor.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Don't touch me!
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
I laugh sometimes
Doesn't suit you.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
Forget it, Ringo.
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
What about all these saloons?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
I'm sorry.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
- Four wheel drive?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
That's reassuring.
Three. You? Married?
No.
Thanks.  Take care -
No?
I hope you'll be gentle.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He was my father's best friend!
Sometimes you just have to -
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
No -
How is it now?
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
That was too close.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
You have to leave -
Yes. Shall we kill them?
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
I pay my own way.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Who is it?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I'm busy.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
What happened to your hand?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Man, act like this is your home.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Whadda ya think?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Right here in the van.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
What are you doing over there?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Right?  Buddy?
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Are you peeking?
I dunno.
MOM!!  MOM!!
That ain't no happy child.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
A lunchbox?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No!  No, no, no, no!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Bad news?!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
There's no mirror.
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Is there anything else I should know about him?
He made that. In his off hours.
Home is where the heart is.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I already lost everything once.
I don't know what you mean.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
I can't find Manolo.
How much?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Carl --
Why?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
Where are you going?
Not yet.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
How long's the job?
...How old are you?
Do you work?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Yes, mom --
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
No --
Yes.
You may speak.
When will you do it?
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Who?
Your new friends.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
Noriega is a criminal.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Who are these guys?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Can you not go yourself.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Where are you going, Diane?
Out.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Can I see you again?
No.
You're too young.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So why have you told me about it?
What? Steady like?
Happy birthday.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Clear?
Have you got any gear on you?
Right.
Exactly.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Lewis Gilbert.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
What do you mean?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
That's your theory?
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
You're all hear.
It was my fucking television.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Your usual table, sir?
This had better be good.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
It's the great outdoors.
Where did she come up with that?
Went ballistic?
A walk.
Homeless people?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Qual se tu?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
He has his doubts...
Sulu, what are you doing?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Captain?
I cannot be certain.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
Now learn something about yourself.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I don't understand...
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Beautiful!
Yeah...?
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Yes?
Hah.
Well, isn't it -- ?
You're alive!
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Not us, I hope.
A User -- in our world?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
New guy...
How?
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
She's still at my house.						*
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
So, it was your first time.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
My husband can't know about this.
I can do it!
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
What is it?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Do you still love me?
Yes.
Oh shit.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
So what's your angle?
Like one?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I understand.
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
What's happened?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
His wife.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Gotten your mail yet?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
How come?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
The letter I sent.
Thanks a lot.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Almost four years.
Four hundred bucks.
At the movies?
You didn't do nothing.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
That dazzling imagination.
Yes.
I don't believe so.
I do.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
You don't know him -
I think what you did was...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Cancoon.
Why Cancoon?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm her husband.
You got it.
Tomorrow.
What?
You goin' out?
This shit can't be real.
Tell me.
Is he big league?
Elliot what?
Two guys.
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Don't you?
Say it, goddamn it!
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
I'm really not very -
I really don't know.
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
I don't believe you.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Thank you.
We talked him into it.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Just put it in your purse.
Well?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
What's she doing?
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
I need to go.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
James, why don't we...?
We need gas.
You're sure?
I don't understand what we're doing.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
They hurt you!
What are you talking about???
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Jo...Jose????
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Nine thirty
I think I've heard that before.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You afraid of the dark?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hundred-fifty.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
There's someone in the house.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
I have ideas.
You never did answer my question.
How far is it to California?
Yeah.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
John, please--
There is no us, remember?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
There has to be!
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Let's go in the bedroom.
To get my car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
No.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Is the job done?
You love her, but you hate her?
All I have in the world.
Darrell giving you problems?
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Liar.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
Not from where I stand.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What?
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Kids.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Christ no!
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Give it to me!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
That's a solid name.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Wait a second--
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You love her, but you hate her?
Shhh! Liar.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Got any requests?
I've had time to get over it.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
But you was going to fight for me.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Nope.  Darrell.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Darrell--
Accident.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
No! Okay! Okay!
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Accident.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
A medicine man?
How do you know he's still not here?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You'd never understand.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Hope is a four-letter word.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
But, in particular?
What kind?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Oh.
Four.
What about Jeb?
...I can't remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Megan?
I remember you.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
What was that?
I'm not sure.
Skeptical about what?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'll help you.
How many did you put on that time?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
...I got a present for you.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
That much, huh?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Better re-load it.
When we gonna double back?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
First one what?
Yeah?
You could have it. All of it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Two weeks, I guess.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Jesus.
He's dead, Bill.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
More.
Say, Ned... ?
His pistol must of jammed.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Just like that?
I don't get it.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Get out.
Well, I'm sorry.
No killing?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
How are you, Keaton?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Who is he?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I know he was good.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Then what?
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
I knew him. He would never -
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
He was accused of jury tampering.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Yes.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...I was one of a group of...
Anything special about the case?
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
It's a crime.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Thank you ...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Hello, I'm calling from...
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
I've got to work...
It's over!
No.
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
How old is he?
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yeah.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Ah? That complicates the problem.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
I -- I --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Will you have dinner with me?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Mmm.
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
But I like that one, Scottie.
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Wherever you'd like...
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
No...
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
One shouldn't live alone.
Shopping?
Do you know where you're going?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I don't like them.
Do you hear anything?
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No, I can't tell you!
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
How do you know?
What else?
No.
Don't leave me... stay with me...
No, don't go away!
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
No... we're together...
Why?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Let me go! Let me go!!
Yes.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Would you please go and look?
What's tomorrow?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Well?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Johnny!
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Out. I've got things to do.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well...
You're an asshole Adam.
Go home!
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
What is your problem?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Don't snap at them!
That's one idea.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Who?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
He's right.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Boyd...What have we done?
What are you going to do?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
I'm serious.
You're a fucking moron.
What?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Not really, no.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Why? What's his problem?
That's absurd.
I've seen it on television.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I'll call them from the road.
Of course.
Go have fun. Not too much.
What about the chairs?
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Yeah. You.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Don't even.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
But...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
That's just insecurity.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I think so.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
That ought to be about the end of that.
The first day.
I have no idea.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Greenpeace?
That's a good one.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
That's our plan.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
And this innocent child.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
You must think I'm mad.
He was asking for it.
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
How are you today?
It's a very big one.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
From the terrace.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
I don't know.
You all right?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty—four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
You think he's smart?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
What happens if I can't catch him?
What did you find out?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
I'm still making adjustments...
I'M WHAT?!
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was me, what?
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
What did you do to those people?
Enjoying yourself?
This isn't a game, Parker!
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Which way?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
What would do that...?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Twenty thousand dollars.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
...but...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...<u>nothing</u>...
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
We'll be back tonight.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...uh huh...
...Stanley Moss...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
He thinks it's too...
Wilfred.
What about him?
Stanley, you can't do this....
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Where is he?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Heavy weather East of here.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do people go to war?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
What do you think would hold it off?
...uh ... No, that's...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
President's speech.
The War ain't over. 
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Of what?
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Mmm.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
What're you doing?
I'm looking for a phone...
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
All part of the Service we Render.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
...mmm.
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Please, no thanks... 
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hey the door was open.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Sell?
Alright. Why so pissed?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
You sure?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Know the name?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What the hell do you want?
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
You could have a great beach house for that.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Well, why stop at that?
...isn't it perfect!
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Your books Master Loftmore
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
What?  Tony and China, together?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Well?
Can this be stopped?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
No, he wouldn't.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What do you mean?
No.  But once I heard...
I didn't want to come.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
This fence...it's so...
And then you weren't there.
No.  No, I don't.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
...just so she could cut them off.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She got it.  Turned it down.
How you holding up?
You are?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Seance.
Telling you...
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
But Claire--
I know.
Jody he was lying.
I guess not.
When's she out of here?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
How are you?
Not the focus.
After that.
Of him I think.
Why?
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
In the house.  I was scared.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
That's...
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
What?
See?
...like it never even happened...
Harvey says he's amazing.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
We had a seance.
Yep.
You know I am.
But I don't remember.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's too rough.
Your wife...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I know.
Then what is he...?
There are two.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Michael, Rowan should -
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Who is this...?
I had you sent away.
Stop it!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
uh - then he - be just -
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
A girl...?
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Harder...
Rowan...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Doctor's orders- - -?
You sure...?
That's GREAT!
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
When aid you get home last night...?
What were you talking about...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
So there is only one key...
It doesn't mention 'females only'
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
It's been what, three years?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Get them together.
These are real, live women?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
You have changed since second grade.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
You do know how to drive?
Some of them have to be automatics.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
My new bike.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Great.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Me-ow.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
But who would run the store?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
As much as possible.
I do?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
My father must've been amazing.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
People pay good money for that?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
How quaint.
How you doing, Artie?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
She still work there?
I understand.
Try, Kelly.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
No.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
You could say that.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
Yeah.
Why?
Where's this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
Just tell us what happened.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You didn't cuff her?
The teeth, were they...
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you looking at?
Get off my property.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Where is she?
It doesn't look like it.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
And she wanted to talk.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Jesus, man... You okay?
Sam...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
But don't pull that again.
Starting with a screw?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Now, what was that?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
Well... that, too.
It is?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Are those just button buttons or...?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
She's perfectly safe.
Private train?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Nicely said, sir.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
The first.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Thank you, friend.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
Who is that girl, anyway?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
I will.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
You must learn magic.
What do I need for that?
What'd you bit me for!!
His will.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
We gotta follow them.
Milking?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, why?...
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
I saw him.
Hey, Sam...
Oh, he's good.
What have you got?
Maybe.
Who else knows?
Johnny –
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
We do not go into your courts.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
No, no doctor...
Only the elders.
What?
Something wrong with buttons?
We had some lemonade and he left.
What else can you do?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
I hear you.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Did you find him?
Is the English dead?
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
She say where he is?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Momma... are they angry with us.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Hickory!
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
That's our farm!
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
...bed.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
And bears!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...don't talk.
They would?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Dorothy next!
That's right.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
We do.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh - look out.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
...to Dorothy!
No, you don't.
Stop that dog!
You new?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What is it?
He’s sealed himself in.
I was the one who brought that money in...
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
The name?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
James...
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Now...where were we?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
No! Bond!
I’ll send someone out.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
What about our end?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
A whore fucking.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Blake?  Dead?
I'm here, Laurie.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
What??
Adrian -- you've lost it.
I¹m not.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Old?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I don't know their real names!
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
What does this mean?  What does it --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Up yours.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Who are you?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
This is your standard dart gun.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Help me with this guy.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Let go.
What do you want?
How?
I lost him.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Of course.
Yes.
And your passport?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
Are you putting me on?
Are these your bags?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
What?
What is this place?
What a filthy job!
Throw the second switch!
What?
Throw the third switch!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
... I'm glad that's...
Thanks...for all your help.
What monster?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
That sound good, boss.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Right here?
I thought it was wonderful.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Yes?
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
